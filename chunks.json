  "History of computing": [
    "The history of computing is longer than the history of computing hardware and modern computing technology and includes the history of methods intended for pen and paper or for chalk and slate, with or without the aid of tables. == Concrete devices == Digital computing is intimately tied to the representation of numbers. But long before abstractions like the number arose, there were mathematical concepts to serve the purposes of civilization. These concepts are implicit in concrete practices such as: One-to-one correspondence, a rule to count how many items, e.g. on a tally stick, eventually abstracted into numbers. Comparison to",
    "on a tally stick, eventually abstracted into numbers. Comparison to a standard, a method for assuming reproducibility in a measurement, for example, the number of coins. The 3-4-5 right triangle was a device for assuring a right angle, using ropes with 12 evenly spaced knots, for example. == Numbers == Eventually, the concept of numbers became concrete and familiar enough for counting to arise, at times with sing-song mnemonics to teach sequences to others. All known human languages, except the Piraha language, have words for at least the numerals \"one\" and \"two\", and even some animals like the blackbird can distinguish a surprising number of items.Advances in the numeral system",
    "distinguish a surprising number of items.Advances in the numeral system and mathematical notation eventually led to the discovery of mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, and so forth. Eventually, the operations were formalized, and concepts about the operations became understood well enough to be stated formally, and even proven. See, for example, Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. By the High Middle Ages, the positional Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system had reached Europe, which allowed for the systematic computation of numbers. During this period, the representation of a calculation on paper allowed the calculation of mathematical expressions, and the tabulation of mathematical",
    "the calculation of mathematical expressions, and the tabulation of mathematical functions such as the square root and the common logarithm (for use in multiplication and division) and the trigonometric functions. By the time of Isaac Newton's research, paper or vellum was an important computing resource, and even in our present time, researchers like Enrico Fermi would cover random scraps of paper with calculation, to satisfy their curiosity about an equation. Even into the period of programmable calculators, Richard Feynman would unhesitatingly compute any steps which overflowed the memory of the calculators, by hand, just to learn the answer; by 1976 Feynman had purchased an HP-25 calculator with a 49 program-step",
    "Feynman had purchased an HP-25 calculator with a 49 program-step capacity; if a differential equation required more than 49 steps to solve, he could just continue his computation by hand. == Early computation == Mathematical statements need not be abstract only; when a statement can be illustrated with actual numbers, the numbers can be communicated and a community can arise. This allows the repeatable, verifiable statements which are the hallmark of mathematics and science. These kinds of statements have existed for thousands of years, and across multiple civilizations, as shown below: The earliest known tool for use in computation is the Sumerian abacus, and it was thought to have been",
    "the Sumerian abacus, and it was thought to have been invented in Babylon c. 2700\u20132300 BC. Its original style of usage was by lines drawn in sand with pebbles. Abaci, of a more modern design, are still used as calculation tools today. This was the first known calculator and most advanced system of calculation known to date - preceding Archimedes by 2,000 years. In c. 1050\u2013771 BC, the south-pointing chariot was invented in ancient China. It was the first known geared mechanism to use a differential gear, which was later used in analog computers. The Chinese also invented a more sophisticated abacus from around the 2nd century BC known as",
    "sophisticated abacus from around the 2nd century BC known as the Chinese abacus.In the 5th century BC in ancient India, the grammarian P\u0101\u1e47ini formulated the grammar of Sanskrit in 3959 rules known as the Ashtadhyayi which was highly systematized and technical. Panini used metarules, transformations and recursions.In the 3rd century BC, Archimedes used the mechanical principle of balance (see Archimedes Palimpsest \u00a7 The Method of Mechanical Theorems) to calculate mathematical problems, such as the number of grains of sand in the universe (The sand reckoner), which also required a recursive notation for numbers (e.g., the myriad myriad). The Antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer.",
    "is believed to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer. It was designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was discovered in 1901 in the Antikythera wreck off the Greek island of Antikythera, between Kythera and Crete, and has been dated to circa 100 BC. Mechanical analog computer devices appeared again a thousand years later in the medieval Islamic world and were developed by Muslim astronomers, such as the mechanical geared astrolabe by Ab\u016b Rayh\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b, and the torquetum by Jabir ibn Aflah. According to Simon Singh, Muslim mathematicians also made important advances in cryptography, such as the development of cryptanalysis and frequency analysis by Alkindus. Programmable machines were also invented",
    "and frequency analysis by Alkindus. Programmable machines were also invented by Muslim engineers, such as the automatic flute player by the Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 brothers, and Ismail al-Jazari's humanoid robots and castle clock, which is considered to be the first programmable analog computer.During the Middle Ages, several European philosophers made attempts to produce analog computer devices. Influenced by the Arabs and Scholasticism, Majorcan philosopher Ramon Llull (1232\u20131315) devoted a great part of his life to defining and designing several logical machines that, by combining simple and undeniable philosophical truths, could produce all possible knowledge. These machines were never actually built, as they were more of a thought experiment to produce new",
    "they were more of a thought experiment to produce new knowledge in systematic ways; although they could make simple logical operations, they still needed a human being for the interpretation of results. Moreover, they lacked a versatile architecture, each machine serving only very concrete purposes. Despite this, Llull's work had a strong influence on Gottfried Leibniz (early 18th century), who developed his ideas further and built several calculating tools using them. Indeed, when John Napier discovered logarithms for computational purposes in the early 17th century, there followed a period of considerable progress by inventors and scientists in making calculating tools. The apex of this early era of formal computing can",
    "The apex of this early era of formal computing can be seen in the Difference Engine and its successor the Analytical Engine both by Charles Babbage. Babbage never completed constructing either engine, but in 2002 Doron Swade and a group of other engineers at the Science Museum in London completed Babbage's Difference Engine using only materials that would have been available in the 1840s. By following Babbage's detailed design they were able to build a functioning engine, allowing historians to say, with some confidence, that if Babbage would have been able to complete his Difference Engine it would have worked. The additionally advanced Analytical Engine combined concepts from his previous",
    "The additionally advanced Analytical Engine combined concepts from his previous work and that of others to create a device that, if constructed as designed, would have possessed many properties of a modern electronic computer, such as an internal \"scratch memory\" equivalent to RAM, multiple forms of output including a bell, a graph-plotter, and simple printer, and a programmable input-output \"hard\" memory of punch cards which it could modify as well as read. The key advancement that Babbage's devices possessed beyond those created before him was that each component of the device was independent of the rest of the machine, much like the components of a modern electronic computer. This was",
    "like the components of a modern electronic computer. This was a fundamental shift in thought; previous computational devices served only a single purpose but had to be at best disassembled and reconfigured to solve a new problem. Babbage's devices could be reprogrammed to solve new problems by the entry of new data and act upon previous calculations within the same series of instructions. Ada Lovelace took this concept one step further, by creating a program for the Analytical Engine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, a complex calculation requiring a recursive algorithm. This is considered to be the first example of a true computer program, a series of instructions that act upon",
    "true computer program, a series of instructions that act upon data not known in full until the program is run. Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. Two other inventors, Leonardo Torres Quevedo and Vannevar Bush, also did follow-on research based on Babbage's work. In his Essays on Automatics (1914) Torres presented the design of an electromechanical calculating machine and introduced the idea of Floating-point arithmetic. In 1920, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the invention of the arithmometer, Torres presented in Paris the Electromechanical Arithmometer, an arithmetic unit connected to",
    "in Paris the Electromechanical Arithmometer, an arithmetic unit connected to a remote typewriter, on which commands could be typed and the results printed automatically. Bush's paper Instrumental Analysis (1936) discussed using existing IBM punch card machines to implement Babbage's design. In the same year, he started the Rapid Arithmetical Machine project to investigate the problems of constructing an electronic digital computer. Several examples of analog computation survived into recent times. A planimeter is a device that does integrals, using distance as the analog quantity. Until the 1980s, HVAC systems used air both as the analog quantity and the controlling element. Unlike modern digital computers, analog computers are not very flexible",
    "Unlike modern digital computers, analog computers are not very flexible and need to be reconfigured (i.e., reprogrammed) manually to switch them from working on one problem to another. Analog computers had an advantage over early digital computers in that they could be used to solve complex problems using behavioral analogues while the earliest attempts at digital computers were quite limited. Since computers were rare in this era, the solutions were often hard-coded into paper forms such as nomograms, which could then produce analog solutions to these problems, such as the distribution of pressures and temperatures in a heating system. == Digital electronic computers == The \"brain\" [computer] may one day",
    "Digital electronic computers == The \"brain\" [computer] may one day come down to our level [of the common people] and help with our income-tax and book-keeping calculations. But this is speculation and there is no sign of it so far. None of the early computational devices were computers in the modern sense, and it took considerable advancement in mathematics and theory before the first modern computers could be designed. In an 1886 letter, Charles Sanders Peirce described how logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. During 1880-81 he showed that NOR gates alone (or NAND gates alone) can be used to reproduce the functions of all the",
    "can be used to reproduce the functions of all the other logic gates, but this work on it was unpublished until 1933. The first published proof was by Henry M. Sheffer in 1913, so the NAND logical operation is sometimes called Sheffer stroke; the logical NOR is sometimes called Peirce's arrow. Consequently, these gates are sometimes called universal logic gates.Eventually, vacuum tubes replaced relays for logic operations. Lee De Forest's modification, in 1907, of the Fleming valve can be used as a logic gate. Ludwig Wittgenstein introduced a version of the 16-row truth table as proposition 5.101 of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921). Walther Bothe, inventor of the coincidence circuit, got part",
    "(1921). Walther Bothe, inventor of the coincidence circuit, got part of the 1954 Nobel Prize in physics, for the first modern electronic AND gate in 1924. Konrad Zuse designed and built electromechanical logic gates for his computer Z1 (from 1935 to 1938). The first recorded idea of using digital electronics for computing was the 1931 paper \"The Use of Thyratrons for High Speed Automatic Counting of Physical Phenomena\" by C. E. Wynn-Williams. From 1934 to 1936, NEC engineer Akira Nakashima, Claude Shannon, and Victor Shestakov published papers introducing switching circuit theory, using digital electronics for Boolean algebraic operations.In 1936 Alan Turing published his seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an",
    "Turing published his seminal paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem in which he modeled computation in terms of a one-dimensional storage tape, leading to the idea of the Universal Turing machine and Turing-complete systems.The first digital electronic computer was developed in the period April 1936 - June 1939, in the IBM Patent Department, Endicott, New York by Arthur Halsey Dickinson. In this computer IBM introduced, a calculating device with a keyboard, processor and electronic output (display). The competitor to IBM was the digital electronic computer NCR3566, developed in NCR, Dayton, Ohio by Joseph Desch and Robert Mumma in the period April 1939 - August 1939. The",
    "Mumma in the period April 1939 - August 1939. The IBM and NCR machines were decimal, executing addition and subtraction in binary position code. In December 1939 John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry completed their experimental model to prove the concept of the Atanasoff\u2013Berry computer. This experimental model is binary, executed addition and subtraction in octal binary code and is the first binary digital electronic computing device. The Atanasoff\u2013Berry computer was intended to solve systems of linear equations, though it was not programmable and it was never completed. The Z3 computer, built by German inventor Konrad Zuse in 1941, was the first programmable, fully automatic computing machine, but it was not",
    "first programmable, fully automatic computing machine, but it was not electronic. During World War II, ballistics computing was done by women, who were hired as \"computers.\" The term computer remained one that referred to mostly women (now seen as \"operator\") until 1945, after which it took on the modern definition of machinery it presently holds.The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) was the first electronic general-purpose computer, announced to the public in 1946. It was Turing-complete, digital, and capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems. Women implemented the programming for machines like the ENIAC, and men created the hardware.The Manchester Baby was the first electronic",
    "men created the hardware.The Manchester Baby was the first electronic stored-program computer. It was built at the Victoria University of Manchester by Frederic C. Williams, Tom Kilburn and Geoff Tootill, and ran its first program on 21 June 1948.William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs invented the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in 1947, followed by the bipolar junction transistor in 1948. At the University of Manchester in 1953, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built the first transistorized computer, called the Transistor Computer, a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. The first stored-program transistor computer was the ETL",
    "of valves. The first stored-program transistor computer was the ETL Mark III, developed by Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory from 1954 to 1956. However, early junction transistors were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass-production basis, which limited them to a number of specialized applications.In 1954, 95% of computers in service were being used for engineering and scientific purposes. === Personal computers === The metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistor (MOSFET), also known as the MOS transistor, was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. The MOSFET",
    "and mass-produced for a wide range of uses. The MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuit chips. The MOSFET is the most widely used transistor in computers, and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics.The silicon-gate MOS integrated circuit was developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968. This led to the development of the first single-chip microprocessor, the Intel 4004. The Intel 4004 was developed as a single-chip microprocessor from 1969 to 1970, led by Intel's Federico Faggin, Marcian Hoff, and Stanley Mazor, and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima. The chip was mainly designed and realized by Faggin, with his silicon-gate MOS technology. The microprocessor led to",
    "Faggin, with his silicon-gate MOS technology. The microprocessor led to the microcomputer revolution, with the development of the microcomputer, which would later be called the personal computer (PC). Most early microprocessors, such as the Intel 8008 and Intel 8080, were 8-bit. Texas Instruments released the first fully 16-bit microprocessor, the TMS9900 processor, in June 1976. They used the microprocessor in the TI-99/4 and TI-99/4A computers. The 1980s brought about significant advances with microprocessors that greatly impacted the fields of engineering and other sciences. The Motorola 68000 microprocessor had a processing speed that was far superior to the other microprocessors being used at the time. Because of this, having a newer,",
    "used at the time. Because of this, having a newer, faster microprocessor allowed for the newer microcomputers that came along after to be more efficient in the amount of computing they were able to do. This was evident in the 1983 release of the Apple Lisa. The Lisa was one of the first personal computers with a graphical user interface (GUI) that was sold commercially. It ran on the Motorola 68000 CPU and used both dual floppy disk drives and a 5 MB hard drive for storage. The machine also had 1MB of RAM used for running software from disk without rereading the disk persistently. After the failure of the",

After the failure of the Lisa in terms of sales, Apple released its first Macintosh computer, still running on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, but with only 128KB of RAM, one floppy drive, and no hard drive to lower the price. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we see more advancements with computers becoming more useful for actual computational purposes. In 1989, Apple released the Macintosh Portable, it weighed 7.3 kg (16 lb) and was extremely expensive, costing US$7,300. At launch, it was one of the most powerful laptops available, but due to the price and weight, it was not met with great success and",
    "and weight, it was not met with great success and was discontinued only two years later. That same year Intel introduced the Touchstone Delta supercomputer, which had 512 microprocessors. This technological advancement was very significant, as it was used as a model for some of the fastest multi-processor systems in the world. It was even used as a prototype for Caltech researchers, who used the model for projects like real-time processing of satellite images and simulating molecular models for various fields of research. === Supercomputers === In terms of supercomputing, the first widely acknowledged supercomputer was the Control Data Corporation (CDC) 6600 built in 1964 by Seymour Cray. Its maximum",
    "(CDC) 6600 built in 1964 by Seymour Cray. Its maximum speed was 40 MHz or 3 million floating point operations per second (FLOPS). The CDC 6600 was replaced by the CDC 7600 in 1969; although its normal clock speed was not faster than the 6600, the 7600 was still faster due to its peak clock speed, which was approximately 30 times faster than that of the 6600. Although CDC was a leader in supercomputers, their relationship with Seymour Cray (which had already been deteriorating) completely collapsed. In 1972, Cray left CDC and began his own company, Cray Research Inc. With support from investors in Wall Street, an industry fueled by",

With a clock speed of 80 MHz or 136 megaFLOPS, Cray developed a name for himself in the computing world. By 1982, Cray Research produced the Cray X-MP equipped with multiprocessing and in 1985 released the Cray-2, which continued with the trend of multiprocessing and clocked at 1.9 gigaFLOPS. Cray Research developed the Cray Y-MP in 1988, however afterward struggled to continue to produce supercomputers. This was largely because the Cold War had ended, and the demand for cutting-edge computing by colleges and the",

In 1998, David Bader developed the first Linux supercomputer using commodity parts. While at the University of New Mexico, Bader sought to build a supercomputer running Linux using consumer off-the-shelf parts and a high-speed low-latency interconnection network. The prototype utilized an Alta Technologies \"AltaCluster\" of eight dual, 333 MHz, Intel Pentium II computers running a modified Linux kernel.

RoadRunner was put into production use in April 1999. At the time of its deployment, it was considered one of the 100 fastest supercomputers in the world. Though Linux-based clusters using consumer-grade parts, such as Beowulf, existed before the development of Bader's prototype and RoadRunner, they lacked the scalability, bandwidth, and parallel computing capabilities to be considered \"true\" supercomputers.Today,",

As of April 2023, the fastest supercomputer is Frontier. == Navigation and astronomy == Starting with known special cases, the calculation of logarithms and trigonometric functions can be performed by looking up numbers in a mathematical table, and interpolating between known cases. For small enough differences, this linear operation was accurate enough for use in navigation and astronomy in the Age of Exploration. The uses of interpolation have",
    "in the Age of Exploration. The uses of interpolation have thrived in the past 500 years: by the twentieth century Leslie Comrie and W.J. Eckert systematized the use of interpolation in tables of numbers for punch card calculation. == Weather prediction == The numerical solution of differential equations, notably the Navier-Stokes equations was an important stimulus to computing, with Lewis Fry Richardson's numerical approach to solving differential equations. The first computerized weather forecast was performed in 1950 by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Duncan Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fj\u00f8rtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan von Neumann.

In the modern era before the 1960s, computing was widely seen as \"women's work\" since it was associated with the operation of tabulating machines and other mechanical office work. The accuracy of this association varied from place to place. In America, Margaret Hamilton",
    "association varied from place to place. In America, Margaret Hamilton recalled an environment dominated by men, while Elsie Shutt recalled surprise at seeing even half of the computer operators at Raytheon were men. Machine operators in Britain were mostly women into the early 1970s. As these perceptions changed and computing became a high-status career, the field became more dominated by men. Professor Janet Abbate, in her book Recoding Gender, writes:Yet women were a significant presence in the early decades of computing. They made up the majority of the first computer programmers during World War II; they held positions of responsibility and influence in the early computer industry; and they were",

Some female programmers of the 1950s and 1960s would have scoffed at the notion that programming would ever be considered a masculine occupation, yet these women\u2019s experiences and contributions were forgotten all too quickly.

    "upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and other fields. == Goals == The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research. === Reasoning, problem-solving === Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems",
    "of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger. Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments. Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. === Knowledge representation === Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.A knowledge base is a",
    "from large databases), and other areas.A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. Knowledge bases need to represent things such as: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events, states and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most",
    "many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally). There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications. === Planning and decision making === An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the",
    "takes actions to make them happen. In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal. In automated decision making, the agent has preferences \u2013 there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the",
    "expected utility.In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to",
    "inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could",
    "associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g. by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.Game theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents. === Learning === Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning.There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in",
    "human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\". Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.Computational learning theory can assess",
    "all of these types of learning.Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization. === Natural language processing === Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning, and not grammar that was the key to",
    "was meaning, and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others. In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023 these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications. === Perception === Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless",
    "to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.The field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition, and robotic perception. === Social intelligence === Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood. For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human\u2013computer interaction. However, this tends to give na\u00efve",
    "otherwise facilitate human\u2013computer interaction. However, this tends to give na\u00efve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject. === General intelligence === A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. == Techniques == AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above. === Search and optimization === AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are",
    "problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search. ==== State space search ==== State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. \"Heuristics\" or \"rules",
    "that is too slow or never completes. \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help to prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position. ==== Local search ==== Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train",
    "function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails). === Logic === Formal Logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation. Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\",",
    "true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\") and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").Logical inference (or deduction) is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are already known to be true (the premises). A logical knowledge base also handles queries and assertions as a special case of inference. An inference rule describes what is a valid step in a proof. The most general inference rule is resolution. Inference can be reduced to performing a search to",
    "resolution. Inference can be reduced to performing a search to find a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule. Inference performed this way is intractable except for short proofs in restricted domains. No efficient, powerful and general method has been discovered. Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.Non-monotonic logics are designed to handle default reasoning. Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains (see knowledge representation above). === Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning === Many problems in AI (including in",
    "for uncertain reasoning === Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.Bayesian networks are a very general tool that can be used for many problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models",
    "analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters). Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design. === Classifiers and statistical learning methods === The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based",
    "to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.There are many kinds of classifiers in use. The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. The naive Bayes",
    "(SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s. The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.Neural networks are also used as classifiers. === Artificial neural networks === An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns, once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to",
    "weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories",
    "output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.Perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons, deep learning uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other \u2013 this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object. === Deep learning === Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in",
    "extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023. The sudden success of deep learning in 2012\u20132015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people,",
    "neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet. === GPT === Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences (natural language processing). Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text which can be from the internet. The pre-training consists in predicting the next token (a token",
    "The pre-training consists in predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pre-training, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world, and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are still prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots which allow you to ask a question or request a task in simple text.Current models and services include: Bard, ChatGPT, Grok,",
    "in simple text.Current models and services include: Bard, ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot and LLaMA. Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound and text. === Specialized hardware and software === In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software, had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training. Historically, specialized languages, such as Lisp, Prolog, Python and others, had been used. == Applications == AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the",
    "is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok). === Health and Medicine === The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic",
    "and quality of life. Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients. For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating Big Data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. New AI tools can deepen our understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a",
    "in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein. In 2023 it was reported that AI guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. === Games === Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997. In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo",
    "Ken Jennings, by a significant margin. In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then in 2017 it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world. Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus. DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games. In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of",
    "particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. In 2021 an AI agent competed in a Playstation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world\u2019s best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. === Military === Various countries are deploying AI military applications. The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability. Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving",
    "deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams. AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria. In November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of IA. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology. === Generative AI === In the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. In March 2023, 58% of US adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it. The increasing realism and ease-of-use of",
    "14% had tried it. The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts. === Industry Specific Tasks === There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. A few",
    "had incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes. A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly",
    "to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights\" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. It could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. == Ethics == AI, like any powerful technology, has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve",
    "serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\". However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.Anyone looking to use machine learning as part of real-world, in-production systems needs to factor ethics into their AI training processes and strive to avoid bias. This is especially true when using AI algorithms that are inherently unexplainable in deep learning. === Risks and harm === ==== Privacy and copyright ==== Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. Technology",
    "data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. Technology companies collect a wide range of data from their users, including online activity, geolocation data, video and audio. For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon have recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while",
    "have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy. Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, began to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\".Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under a rationale of \"fair use\". Also website owners who do not wish to have their copyrighted content be AI indexed or \u2018scraped\u2019 can add code",
    "copyrighted content be AI indexed or \u2018scraped\u2019 can add code to their site, as you would, if you did not want your website to be indexed by a search engine which is currently available to certain services such as OpenAI. Experts disagree about how well, and under what circumstances, this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\". In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI. ==== Misinformation ==== YouTube, Facebook",
    "work to train generative AI. ==== Misinformation ==== YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in",
    "that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government. The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem. In 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda. AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other",
    "to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks. ==== Algorithmic bias and fairness ==== Machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data. The developers may not be aware that the bias exists. Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.Fairness in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias. It has become serious area of",
    "caused by algorithmic bias. It has become serious area of academic study within AI. Researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define \"fairness\" in a way that satisfies all stakeholders.On June 28, 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, a problem called \"sample size disparity\". Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook,",
    "a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different\u2014the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend. In 2017, several researchers showed that it",
    "would not re-offend. In 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\". Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"Criticism of",
    "research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"Criticism of COMPAS highlighted a deeper problem with the misuse of AI. Machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. Unfortunately, if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist. Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future",
    "decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive.Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022) the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings recommending that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed. ==== Lack",
    "sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed. ==== Lack of transparency ==== Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically",
    "with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are required",
    "a right to an explanation. Doctors, for example, are required to clearly and completely explain the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists. Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.DARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try and solve these problems.There are several potential solutions to the transparency problem. SHAP helps visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.",
    "helps visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. LIME can locally approximate a model with a simpler, interpretable model. Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. ==== Conflict, surveillance and weaponized AI ==== A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to",
    "human supervision. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots. These weapons are considered especially dangerous for several reasons: if they kill an innocent person it is not clear who should be held accountable, it is unlikely they will reliably choose targets, and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.AI provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments: smart spyware, face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance",
    "face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect; deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation; advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.AI facial recognition systems are used for mass surveillance, notably in China. In 2019, Bengaluru, India deployed AI-managed traffic signals. This system uses cameras to monitor traffic density and adjust signal timing based on the interval needed to clear traffic. Terrorists, criminals and rogue states can use weaponized",

Machine-learning AI is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours. ==== Technological unemployment ==== From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments, for example those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is",
    "redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI. A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only",
    "risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\". The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\". Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related",
    "cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illlustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence. ==== Existential risk ==== It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\". This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character. These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.",
    "malevolent character. These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager). Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\" In order to be safe",
    "the coffee if you're dead.\" In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.The",
    "to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI. Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk have expressed concern about existential risk from AI.In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.AI pioneers including Fei-Fei Li, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Cynthia Breazeal, Rana el",
    "Fei-Fei Li, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Cynthia Breazeal, Rana el Kaliouby, Demis Hassabis, Joy Buolamwini, and Sam Altman have expressed concerns about the risks of AI. In 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".Other researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\" While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can",
    "tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\" Andrew Ng also argued that \"it\u2019s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI\u2014and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers\u2019 dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\" ==== Limiting AI ==== Possible options for limiting AI include: using Embedded Ethics or Constitutional AI where companies or governments can add a policy, restricting high levels of compute power in training, restricting the ability to rewrite its own code base, restrict certain AI",
    "ability to rewrite its own code base, restrict certain AI techniques but not in the training phase, open-source (transparency) vs proprietary (could be more restricted), backup model with redundancy, restricting security, privacy and copyright, restricting or controlling the memory, real-time monitoring, risk analysis, emergency shut-off, rigorous simulation and testing, model certification, assess known vulnerabilities, restrict the training material, restrict access to the internet, issue terms of use. === Ethical machines and alignment === Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research",
    "argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas. The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality, and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's \"artificial moral agents\" and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines. === Frameworks === Artificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and",

An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values \u2013 developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas: RESPECT the dignity of individual people CONNECT with other people sincerely, openly and inclusively CARE for the wellbeing of everyone PROTECT social values, justice and the public interestOther developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the",

The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in",
    "and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone. Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI. Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, US and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia. The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating",
    "Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI. In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years. In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI",
    "officials and academics.In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\". A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity. In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the",
    "AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks. 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. == History == The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate both mathematical",
    "as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the Church\u2013Turing thesis. This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics and information theory, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".Alan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI \u2013 though it is now lost. The first available paper generally recognized as \"AI\" was McCullouch and Pitts design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\" in 1943 \u2013 the first mathematical model of a neural network. The paper was",
    "first mathematical model of a neural network. The paper was influenced by Turing's earlier paper 'On Computable Numbers' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean 'neurons', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function.The term 'machine intelligence' was used by Alan Turing during his life which was later often referred to as 'artificial intelligence' after his death in 1954. In 1950 Turing published the best known of his papers 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', the paper introduced his concept of what is now known as the Turing test to the general public. Then followed three radio broadcasts on AI by Turing, the lectures: 'Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory\u2019, \u2018Can Digital",

By 1956 computer intelligence had been actively pursued for more than a decade in Britain; the earliest AI programmes were written there in 1951\u20131952.In 1951, using a Ferranti Mark 1 computer of the University of Manchester, checkers and chess programs were wrote where you could play against the computer. The field of American AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956. The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s. They and their students produced programs that the press described",
    "They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English. Artificial Intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and US Universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem. Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus",
    "networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether. The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research. However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a",
    "in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.Many researchers began to doubt that the current practices would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches. Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and",
    "of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others. In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics). By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".Several academic researchers became concerned that AI was",
    "as \"artificial intelligence\".Several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field. For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned. Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing) and access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI. The amount",

The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015\u20132019, and WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents. According to 'AI Impacts', about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the US alone and about 20% of new US Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\"; about 800,000 \"AI\"-related US job openings existed in 2022. The large majority of the advances have occurred within the United States, with its companies, universities, and research labs leading artificial intelligence",
    "with its companies, universities, and research labs leading artificial intelligence research.In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study. == Philosophy == === Defining artificial intelligence === Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\" He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\". He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a",
    "devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of \"acting\" and not \"thinking\". However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so",
    "goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\" Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\". These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine\u2014and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even",
    "no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google, a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. === Evaluating approaches to AI === No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history. The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\").",
    "term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow (see below). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. ==== Symbolic AI and its limits ==== Symbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"However, the symbolic approach failed on many",
    "of general intelligent action.\"However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult. Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the",
    "is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. ==== Neat vs. scruffy ==== \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it",
    "as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. ==== Soft vs. hard computing ==== Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late",
    "truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. ==== Narrow vs. general AI ==== AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals. General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this",
    "solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. === Machine consciousness, sentience and mind === The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are",
    "the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\" However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction. ==== Consciousness ==== David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness. The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says",
    "it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like. ==== Computationalism and functionalism ==== Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and",
    "of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind\u2013body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\" Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine",
    "argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind. ==== Robot rights ==== If a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so it could also suffer; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights. Any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. This issue has been considered in fiction for centuries, and is now being considered by, for example, California's Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the",
    "California's Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature. == Future == === Superintelligence and the singularity === A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can",
    "they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do. === Transhumanism === Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998. == In fiction == Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as",
    "== In fiction == Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters.

Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999).

Companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, and Baidu as well as numerous smaller firms have developed generative AI models.Generative AI has uses across a wide range of industries, including software development, healthcare, finance, entertainment, customer service, sales and marketing, art, writing, fashion, and product design. However, concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of generative AI such as cybercrime, the use of fake news or deepfakes to deceive or manipulate people, and the mass replacement of human jobs. == History == The academic discipline of artificial intelligence was established at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956",
    "at a research workshop held at Dartmouth College in 1956 and has experienced several waves of advancement and optimism in the decades since. Since its inception, researchers in the field have raised philosophical and ethical arguments about the nature of the human mind and the consequences of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. The concept of automated art dates back at least to the automata of ancient Greek civilization, where inventors such as Daedalus and Hero of Alexandria were described as having designed machines capable of writing text, generating sounds, and playing music. The tradition of creative",

The tradition of creative automatons has flourished throughout history, exemplified by Maillardet's automaton created in the early 1800s.Artificial Intelligence is an idea that has been captivating society since the mid-20th century. It began with science fiction familiarizing the world with the concept but the idea wasn't fully seen in the scientific manner until Alan Turing, a polymath, was curious about the feasibility of the concept. Turing's groundbreaking 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" posed fundamental questions about machine reasoning similar to human intelligence, significantly contributing to the conceptual groundwork of AI. The development of AI was not very rapid at first because of the",
    "AI was not very rapid at first because of the high costs and the fact that computers were not able to store commands. This changed during the 1956 Dartmouth Summer Research Project on AI where there was an inspiring call for AI research which led it to be a landmark event as it set the precedent for two decades of rapid advancements in the field.Since the founding of AI in the 1950s, artists and researchers have used artificial intelligence to create artistic works.

Markov published his first paper on the topic in 1906, and analyzed the pattern of vowels and consonants in the novel Eugeny Onegin using Markov chains. Once a Markov chain is learned on a text corpus, it can then be used as a probabilistic text generator.The field of machine learning often uses statistical models, including generative models, to model and predict data. Beginning in the late 2000s, the emergence of deep learning drove progress and research in image classification, speech recognition,",
    "learning drove progress and research in image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing and other tasks. Neural networks in this era were typically trained as discriminative models, due to the difficulty of generative modeling.In 2014, advancements such as the variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network produced the first practical deep neural networks capable of learning generative models, as opposed to discriminative ones, for complex data such as images. These deep generative models were the first to output not only class labels for images but also entire images. In 2017, the Transformer network enabled advancements in generative models compared to older Long-Short Term Memory models, leading to the first generative pre-trained",
    "Long-Short Term Memory models, leading to the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), known as GPT-1, in 2018. This was followed in 2019 by GPT-2 which demonstrated the ability to generalize unsupervised to many different tasks as a Foundation model.In 2021, the release of DALL-E, a transformer-based pixel generative model, followed by Midjourney and Stable Diffusion marked the emergence of practical high-quality artificial intelligence art from natural language prompts. In March 2023, GPT-4 was released. A team from Microsoft Research argued that \"it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system\".

The capabilities of a generative AI system depend on the modality or type of the data set used. Generative AI can be either unimodal or multimodal; unimodal systems take only one type of input, whereas multimodal systems can take more than one type of input. For example, one version of OpenAI's GPT-4 accepts both text and image inputs. === Text === Generative AI systems trained",

Generative AI systems trained on sets of images with text captions include Imagen, DALL-E, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, Stable Diffusion and others (see Artificial intelligence art, Generative art, and Synthetic media). They are commonly used for text-to-image generation and neural style transfer. Datasets include LAION-5B and others (See List of datasets in computer vision and image processing). === Audio === Generative AI can also be trained extensively on audio clips to produce natural-sounding speech synthesis and text-to-speech capabilities, exemplified by ElevenLabs' context-aware synthesis tools or Meta Platform's Voicebox.Generative AI systems such as MusicLM and MusicGen can also be trained",
    "systems such as MusicLM and MusicGen can also be trained on the audio waveforms of recorded music along with text annotations, in order to generate new musical samples based on text descriptions such as a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff. === Video === Generative AI trained on annotated video can generate temporally-coherent, detailed and photorealistic video clips. Examples include Sora by OpenAI, Gen-1 and Gen-2 by Runway, and Make-A-Video by Meta Platforms. === Molecules === Generative AI systems can be trained on sequences of amino acids or molecular representations such as SMILES representing DNA or proteins. These systems, such as AlphaFold, are used for protein structure",

Such data can be deployed to validate mathematical models and to train machine learning models while preserving user privacy, including for structured data. The approach is not limited to text generation; image generation has been employed to train computer vision models. === Computer aided design === Artificially intelligent computer-aided design (CAD) can use text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and video-to-3D to automate 3D modeling.

For example, LLaMA-7B (a version with 7 billion parameters) can run on a Raspberry Pi 4 and one version of Stable Diffusion can run on an iPhone 11.Larger models with tens of billions of parameters can run on laptop or desktop computers. To achieve an acceptable speed, models of this size may require accelerators such as the GPU chips produced by NVIDIA and AMD or the Neural Engine included in Apple silicon products. For example, the 65 billion parameter version of LLaMA can be configured to run on a desktop PC.The advantages of running generative AI locally include protection of privacy and",

In 2022, the United States New Export Controls on Advanced Computing and Semiconductors to China imposed restrictions on exports to China of GPU and AI accelerator chips used for generative AI. Chips such as the NVIDIA A800 and the Biren Technology BR104 were developed to meet the requirements of the sanctions.

    "A large language model (LLM) is a language model notable for its ability to achieve general-purpose language generation and understanding. LLMs acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. LLMs are artificial neural networks, the largest and most capable of which are built with a transformer-based architecture. Some recent implementations are based on other architectures, such as recurrent neural network variants and Mamba (a state space model).LLMs can be used for text generation, a form of generative AI, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token",

Larger sized models, such as GPT-3, however, can be prompt-engineered to achieve similar results. They are thought to acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics and \"ontology\" inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.Some notable LLMs are OpenAI's GPT series of models (e.g., GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, used in ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot), Google's PaLM and Gemini (the latter of which is currently used in the chatbot of the same name), Meta's LLaMA",

This paper's goal was to improve upon 2014 Seq2seq technology, and was based mainly on the attention mechanism developed by Bahdanau et al. in 2014. The following year in 2018, BERT was introduced and quickly became \"ubiquitous\". Though the original transformer has both encoder and decoder blocks, BERT is an encoder-only model. Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because",
    "it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use. GPT-3 in 2020 went a step further and as of 2024 is available only via API with no offering of downloading the model to execute locally. But it was the 2022 consumer-facing browser-based ChatGPT that captured the imaginations of the general population and caused some media hype and online buzz. The 2023 GPT-4 was praised for its increased accuracy and as a \"holy grail\" for its multimodal capabilities. OpenAI did not reveal high-level architecture and the number of parameters of GPT-4.

In terms of Elo ratings, on January 26, 2024, Google's Bard (Gemini Pro) surpassed the regular GPT-4, but not the limited-availability GPT-4-Turbo.Since 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use.

As of January 2024, Mixtral 8x7b is the most powerful open LLM according to the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, being more powerful than GPT-3.5 but not as powerful as GPT-4. == Dataset preprocessing == === Probabilistic tokenization === Using a modification of byte-pair encoding, in the first step, all unique characters (including blanks and punctuation marks) are treated as an initial set of n-grams (i.e. initial set of uni-grams). Successively the most frequent pair of adjacent characters is merged into a bi-gram and all instances of the pair are replaced by it. All occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most",
    "occurrences of adjacent pairs of (previously merged) n-grams that most frequently occur together are then again merged into even lengthier n-gram repeatedly until a vocabulary of prescribed size is obtained (in case of GPT-3, the size is 50257). Token vocabulary consists of integers, spanning from zero up to the size of the token vocabulary. New words can always be interpreted as combinations of the tokens and the initial-set uni-grams.A token vocabulary based on the frequencies extracted from mainly English corpora uses as few tokens as possible for an average English word. An average word in another language encoded by such an English-optimized tokenizer is however split into suboptimal amount of",
    "an English-optimized tokenizer is however split into suboptimal amount of tokens. GPT-2 tokenizer can use up to 15 times more tokens per word for some languages, for example for Shan language from Myanmar. Even more widespread languages such as Portuguese and German have \"a premium of 50%\" compared to English.tokenizer: texts -> series of numerical \"tokens\" may be split into: Probabilistic tokenization also compresses the datasets, which is the reason for using the byte pair encoding algorithm as a tokenizer. Because LLMs generally require input to be an array that is not jagged, the shorter texts must be \"padded\" until they match the length of the longest one. How many",
    "they match the length of the longest one. How many tokens are, on average, needed per word depends on the language of the dataset. === Dataset cleaning === In the context of training LLMs, datasets are typically cleaned by removing toxic passages from the dataset, discarding low-quality data, and de-duplication. Cleaned datasets can increase training efficiency and lead to improved downstream performance.With the increasing proportion of LLM-generated content on the web, data cleaning in the future may include filtering out such content. LLM-generated content can pose a problem if the content is similar to human text (making filtering difficult) but of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it).",
    "of lower quality (degrading performance of models trained on it). == Training and architecture == === Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) === Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) through algorithms, such as proximal policy optimization, is used to further fine-tune a model based on a dataset of human preferences. === Instruction tuning === Using \"self-instruct\" approaches, LLMs have been able to bootstrap correct responses, replacing any naive responses, starting from human-generated corrections of a few cases. For example, in the instruction \"Write an essay about the main themes represented in Hamlet,\" an initial naive completion might be 'If you submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be",
    "submit the essay after March 17, your grade will be reduced by 10% for each day of delay,\" based on the frequency of this textual sequence in the corpus. === Mixture of experts === The largest LLM may be too expensive to train and use directly. For such models, mixture of experts (MoE) can be applied, a line of research pursued by Google researchers since 2017 to train models reaching up to 1 trillion parameters. === Prompt engineering, attention mechanism, and context window === Most results previously achievable only by (costly) fine-tuning, can be achieved through prompt engineering, although limited to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited",
    "to the scope of a single conversation (more precisely, limited to the scope of a context window). In order to find out which tokens are relevant to each other within the scope of the context window, the attention mechanism calculates \"soft\" weights for each token, more precisely for its embedding, by using multiple attention heads, each with its own \"relevance\" for calculating its own soft weights. For example, the small (i.e. 117M parameter sized) GPT-2 model, has had twelve attention heads and a context window of only 1k token. In its medium version it has 345M parameters and contains 24 layers, each with 12 attention heads. For the training with",

For the training with gradient descent a batch size of 512 was utilized.The largest models, such as Google's Gemini 1.5, presented in February 2024, can have a context window sized up to 1 million (context window of 10 million was also \"successfully tested\"). Other models with large context windows includes Anthropic's Claude 2.1, with a context window of up to 200k tokens. Note that this maximum refers to the number of input tokens and that the maximum number of output tokens differs from the input and is often smaller. For example, the GPT-4 Turbo model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.Length of a",
    "model has a maximum output of 4096 tokens.Length of a conversation that the model can take into account when generating its next answer is limited by the size of a context window, as well. If the length of a conversation, for example with Chat-GPT, is longer than its context window, only the parts inside the context window are taken into account when generating the next answer, or the model needs to apply some algorithm to summarize the too distant parts of conversation. The shortcomings of making a context window larger include higher computational cost and possibly diluting the focus on local context, while making it smaller can cause a model",
    "local context, while making it smaller can cause a model to miss an important long-range dependency. Balancing them are a matter of experimentation and domain-specific considerations. A model may be pre-trained either to predict how the segment continues, or what is missing in the segment, given a segment from its training dataset. It can be either autoregressive (i.e. predicting how the segment continues, the way GPTs do it): for example given a segment \"I like to eat\", the model predicts \"ice cream\", or \"sushi\". \"masked\" (i.e. filling in the parts missing from the segment, the way \"BERT\" does it): for example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\",",
    "example, given a segment \"I like to [__] [__] cream\", the model predicts that \"eat\" and \"ice\" are missing.Models may be trained on auxiliary tasks which test their understanding of the data distribution, such as Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), in which pairs of sentences are presented and the model must predict whether they appear consecutively in the training corpus. During training, regularization loss is also used to stabilize training. However regularization loss is usually not used during testing and evaluation. == Training cost == Advances in software and hardware have reduced the cost substantially since 2020, such that in 2023 training of a 12-billion-parameter LLM computational cost is 72,300 A100-GPU-hours,",

Since 2020, large sums were invested in increasingly large models. For example, training of the GPT-2 (i.e. a 1.5-billion-parameters model) in 2019 cost $50,000, while training of the PaLM (i.e. a 540-billion-parameters model) in 2022 cost $8 million.For Transformer-based LLM, training cost is much higher than inference cost. It costs 6 FLOPs per parameter to train on one token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter",
    "token, whereas it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token. == Tool use == There are certain tasks that, in principle, cannot be solved by any LLM, at least not without the use of external tools or additional software. An example of such a task is responding to the user's input '354 * 139 = ', provided that the LLM has not already encountered a continuation of this calculation in its training corpus. In such cases, the LLM needs to resort to running program code that calculates the result, which can then be included in its response. Another example is 'What is the time now?",
    "its response. Another example is 'What is the time now? It is ', where a separate program interpreter would need to execute a code to get system time on the computer, so LLM could include it in its reply. This basic strategy can be sophisticated with multiple attempts of generated programs, and other sampling strategies. Cost Savings and Reduced Vendor Dependency Generally, in order to get an LLM to use tools, one must finetune it for tool-use. If the number of tools is finite, then finetuning may be done just once. If the number of tools can grow arbitrarily, as with online API services, then the LLM can be finetuned",
    "with online API services, then the LLM can be finetuned to be able to read API documentation and call API correctly.A simpler form of tool use is Retrieval Augmented Generation: augment an LLM with document retrieval, sometimes using a vector database. Given a query, a document retriever is called to retrieve the most relevant (usually measured by first encoding the query and the documents into vectors, then finding the documents with vectors closest in Euclidean norm to the query vector). The LLM then generates an output based on both the query and the retrieved documents. == Agency == An LLM is a language model, which is not an agent as",
    "is a language model, which is not an agent as it has no goal, but it can be used as a component of an intelligent agent. Researchers have described several methods for such integrations.The ReAct (\"Reason + Act\") method constructs an agent out of an LLM, using the LLM as a planner. The LLM is prompted to \"think out loud\". Specifically, the language model is prompted with a textual description of the environment, a goal, a list of possible actions, and a record of the actions and observations so far. It generates one or more thoughts before generating an action, which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description",
    "which is then executed in the environment. The linguistic description of the environment given to the LLM planner can even be the LaTeX code of a paper describing the environment.In the DEPS (\"Describe, Explain, Plan and Select\") method, an LLM is first connected to the visual world via image descriptions, then it is prompted to produce plans for complex tasks and behaviors based on its pretrained knowledge and environmental feedback it receives.The Reflexion method constructs an agent that learns over multiple episodes. At the end of each episode, the LLM is given the record of the episode, and prompted to think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better",
    "think up \"lessons learned\", which would help it perform better at a subsequent episode. These \"lessons learned\" are given to the agent in the subsequent episodes.Monte Carlo tree search can use an LLM as rollout heuristic. When a programmatic world model is not available, an LLM can also be prompted with a description of the environment to act as world model.For open-ended exploration, an LLM can be used to score observations for their \"interestingness\", which can be used as a reward signal to guide a normal (non-LLM) reinforcement learning agent. Alternatively, it can propose increasingly difficult tasks for curriculum learning. Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also",
    "Instead of outputting individual actions, an LLM planner can also construct \"skills\", or functions for complex action sequences. The skills can be stored and later invoked, allowing increasing levels of abstraction in planning.LLM-powered agents can keep a long-term memory of its previous contexts, and the memory can be retrieved in the same way as Retrieval Augmented Generation. Multiple such agents can interact socially. == Compression == Typically, LLM are trained with full- or half-precision floating point numbers (float32 and float16). One float16 has 16 bits, or 2 bytes, and so one billion parameters require 2 gigabytes. The largest models typically have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which",
    "have 100 billion parameters, requiring 200 gigabytes to load, which places them outside the range of most consumer electronics.Post-training quantization aims to decrease the space requirement by lowering precision of the parameters of a trained model, while preserving most of its performance. The simplest form of quantization simply truncates all numbers to a given number of bits. It can be improved by using a different quantization codebook per layer. Further improvement can be done by applying different precisions to different parameters, with higher precision for particularly important parameters (\"outlier weights\").While quantized models are typically frozen, and only pre-quantized models are finetuned, quantized models can still be finetuned. == Multimodality ==",
    "finetuned, quantized models can still be finetuned. == Multimodality == Multimodality means \"having several modalities\", and a \"modality\" refers to a type of input or output, such as video, image, audio, text, proprioception, etc. There have been many AI models trained specifically to ingest one modality and output another modality, such as AlexNet for image to label, visual question answering for image-text to text, and speech recognition for speech to text. A common method to create multimodal models out of an LLM is to \"tokenize\" the output of a trained encoder. Concretely, one can construct a LLM that can understand images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a",
    "images as follows: take a trained LLM, and take a trained image encoder E {\\displaystyle E} . Make a small multilayered perceptron f {\\displaystyle f} , so that for any image y {\\displaystyle y} , the post-processed vector f ( E ( y ) ) {\\displaystyle f(E(y))} has the same dimensions as an encoded token. That is an \"image token\". Then, one can interleave text tokens and image tokens. The compound model is then finetuned on an image-text dataset. This basic construction can be applied with more sophistication to improve the model. The image encoder may be frozen to improve stability.Flamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a",
    "stability.Flamingo demonstrated the effectiveness of the tokenization method, finetuning a pair of pretrained language model and image encoder to perform better on visual question answering than models trained from scratch. Google PaLM model was finetuned into a multimodal model PaLM-E using the tokenization method, and applied to robotic control. LLaMA models have also been turned multimodal using the tokenization method, to allow image inputs, and video inputs.GPT-4 can use both text and image as inputs (although the vision component wasn't released to the public until GPT-4V); Google DeepMind's Gemini is also multimodal. == Properties == === Scaling laws === The following four hyper-parameters characterize a LLM: cost of (pre-)training (",
    "following four hyper-parameters characterize a LLM: cost of (pre-)training ( C {\\displaystyle C} ), size of the artificial neural network itself, such as number of parameters N {\\displaystyle N} (i.e. amount of neurons in its layers, amount of weights between them and biases), size of its (pre-)training dataset (i.e. number of tokens in corpus, D {\\displaystyle D} ), performance after (pre-)training.They are related by simple statistical laws, called \"scaling laws\". One particular scaling law (\"Chinchilla scaling\") for LLM autoregressively trained for one epoch, with a log-log learning rate schedule, states that: where the variables are C {\\displaystyle C} is the cost of training the model, in FLOPs.

Note that training cost is much higher than inference cost, where it costs 1 to 2 FLOPs per parameter to infer on one token. \u03b1 = 0.34 , \u03b2 = 0.28 , A = 406.4",

However, sometimes the line's slope transitions from one slope to another at point(s) referred to as break(s) in downstream scaling laws, appearing as a series of linear segments connected by arcs; it seems that larger models acquire",
    "segments connected by arcs; it seems that larger models acquire \"emergent abilities\" at this point(s). These abilities are discovered rather than programmed-in or designed, in some cases only after the LLM has been publicly deployed.The most intriguing among emergent abilities is in-context learning from example demonstrations. In-context learning is involved in tasks, such as: reported arithmetics, decoding the International Phonetic Alphabet, unscrambling a word's letters, disambiguate word in context, converting spatial words, cardinal directions (for example, replying \"northeast\" upon [0, 0, 1; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0]), color terms represented in text. chain-of-thought prompting: Model outputs are improved by chain-of-thought prompting only when model size exceeds 62B. Smaller models",

Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought. identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs.Schaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well.Let x {\\displaystyle x} be the number of parameter count, and y {\\displaystyle y} be",
    "the number of parameter count, and y {\\displaystyle y} be the performance of the model. == Interpretation == Large language models by themselves are \"black boxes\", and it is not clear how they can perform linguistic tasks. There are several methods for understanding how LLM work. Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer LLM by discovering symbolic algorithms that approximate the inference performed by LLM. One example is Othello-GPT, where a small Transformer is trained to predict legal Othello moves. It is found that there is a linear representation of Othello board, and modifying the representation changes the predicted legal Othello moves in the correct way. In another example, a small Transformer",
    "in the correct way. In another example, a small Transformer is trained on Karel programs. Similar to the Othello-GPT example, there is a linear representation of Karel program semantics, and modifying the representation changes output in the correct way. The model also generates correct programs that are on average shorter than those in the training set.In another example, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform. === Understanding and intelligence === NLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs \"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents",
    "\"could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense\". Proponents of \"LLM understanding\" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an ability to \"understand\" certain concepts. A Microsoft team argued in 2023 that GPT-4 \"can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more\" and that GPT-4 \"could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence system\": \"Can one reasonably say that a system that passes exams for software engineering candidates is not really intelligent?\" Some researchers characterize LLMs as \"alien intelligence\". For example, Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like",
    "Conjecture CEO Connor Leahy considers untuned LLMs to be like inscrutable alien \"Shoggoths\", and believes that RLHF tuning creates a \"smiling facade\" obscuring the inner workings of the LLM: \"If you don't push it too far, the smiley face stays on. But then you give it [an unexpected] prompt, and suddenly you see this massive underbelly of insanity, of weird thought processes and clearly non-human understanding.\"In contrast, some proponents of the \"LLMs lack understanding\" school believe that existing LLMs are \"simply remixing and recombining existing writing\", or point to the deficits existing LLMs continue to have in prediction skills, reasoning skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits",
    "skills, agency, and explainability. For example, GPT-4 has natural deficits in planning and in real-time learning. Generative LLMs have been observed to confidently assert claims of fact which do not seem to be justified by their training data, a phenomenon which has been termed \"hallucination\". Specifically, hallucinations in the context of LLMs correspond to the generation of text or responses that seem syntactically sound, fluent, and natural but are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or unfaithful to the provided source input. Neuroscientist Terrence Sejnowski has argued that \"The diverging opinions of experts on the intelligence of LLMs suggests that our old ideas based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".The matter of LLM's exhibiting",
    "based on natural intelligence are inadequate\".The matter of LLM's exhibiting intelligence or understanding has two main aspects - the first is how to model thought and language in a computer system, and the second is how to enable the computer system to generate human like language. These aspects of language as a model of cognition have been developed in the field of cognitive linguistics. American linguist George Lakoff presented Neural Theory of Language (NTL) as a computational basis for using language as a model of learning tasks and understanding. The NTL Model outlines how specific neural structures of the human brain shape the nature of thought and language and in",
    "brain shape the nature of thought and language and in turn what are the computational properties of such neural systems that can be applied to model thought and language in a computer system. After a framework for modeling language in a computer systems was established, the focus shifted to establishing frameworks for computer systems to generate language with acceptable grammar. In his 2014 book titled The Language Myth: Why Language Is Not An Instinct, British cognitive linguist and digital communication technologist Vyvyan Evans mapped out the role of probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) in enabling NLP to model cognitive patterns and generate human like language. == Evaluation == === Perplexity ===",
    "generate human like language. == Evaluation == === Perplexity === The most commonly used measure of a language model's performance is its perplexity on a given text corpus. Perplexity is a measure of how well a model is able to predict the contents of a dataset; the higher the likelihood the model assigns to the dataset, the lower the perplexity. Mathematically, perplexity is defined as the exponential of the average negative log likelihood per token:here N {\\displaystyle N} is the number of tokens in the text corpus, and \"context for token i {\\displaystyle i} \" depends on the specific type of LLM used. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context",
    "of LLM used. If the LLM is autoregressive, then \"context for token i {\\displaystyle i} \" is the segment of text appearing before token i {\\displaystyle i} . If the LLM is masked, then \"context for token i {\\displaystyle i} \" is the segment of text surrounding token i {\\displaystyle i} . Because language models may overfit to their training data, models are usually evaluated by their perplexity on a test set of unseen data. This presents particular challenges for the evaluation of large language models. As they are trained on increasingly large corpora of text largely scraped from the web, it becomes increasingly likely that models' training data inadvertently",
    "web, it becomes increasingly likely that models' training data inadvertently includes portions of any given test set. ==== BPW, BPC, and BPT ==== In information theory, the concept of entropy is intricately linked to perplexity, a relationship notably established by Claude Shannon. This relationship is mathematically expressed as Entropy = log 2 \u2061 ( Perplexity ) {\\displaystyle {\\text{Entropy}}=\\log _{2}({\\text{Perplexity}})} . Entropy, in this context, is commonly quantified in terms of bits per word (BPW) or bits per character (BPC), which hinges on whether the language model utilizes word-based or character-based tokenization. Notably, in the case of larger language models that predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as",
    "predominantly employ sub-word tokenization, bits per token (BPT) emerges as a seemingly more appropriate measure. However, due to the variance in tokenization methods across different Large Language Models (LLMs), BPT does not serve as a reliable metric for comparative analysis among diverse models. To convert BPT into BPW, one can multiply it by the average number of tokens per word. In the evaluation and comparison of language models, cross-entropy is generally the preferred metric over entropy. The underlying principle is that a lower BPW is indicative of a model's enhanced capability for compression. This, in turn, reflects the model's proficiency in making accurate predictions. === Task-specific datasets and benchmarks ===",
    "in making accurate predictions. === Task-specific datasets and benchmarks === A large number of testing datasets and benchmarks have also been developed to evaluate the capabilities of language models on more specific downstream tasks. Tests may be designed to evaluate a variety of capabilities, including general knowledge, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. One broad category of evaluation dataset is question answering datasets, consisting of pairs of questions and correct answers, for example, (\"Have the San Jose Sharks won the Stanley Cup?\", \"No\"). A question answering task is considered \"open book\" if the model's prompt includes text from which the expected answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could",
    "answer can be derived (for example, the previous question could be adjoined with some text which includes the sentence \"The Sharks have advanced to the Stanley Cup finals once, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2016.\"). Otherwise, the task is considered \"closed book\", and the model must draw on knowledge retained during training. Some examples of commonly used question answering datasets include TruthfulQA, Web Questions, TriviaQA, and SQuAD.Evaluation datasets may also take the form of text completion, having the model select the most likely word or sentence to complete a prompt, for example: \"Alice was friends with Bob. Alice went to visit her friend, ____\".Some composite benchmarks have also been",
    "to visit her friend, ____\".Some composite benchmarks have also been developed which combine a diversity of different evaluation datasets and tasks. Examples include GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, BIG-bench, and HELM.It was previously standard to report results on a heldout portion of an evaluation dataset after doing supervised fine-tuning on the remainder. It is now more common to evaluate a pre-trained model directly through prompting techniques, though researchers vary in the details of how they formulate prompts for particular tasks, particularly with respect to how many examples of solved tasks are adjoined to the prompt (i.e. the value of n in n-shot prompting). ==== Adversarially constructed evaluations ==== Because of the rapid",
    "prompting). ==== Adversarially constructed evaluations ==== Because of the rapid pace of improvement of large language models, evaluation benchmarks have suffered from short lifespans, with state of the art models quickly \"saturating\" existing benchmarks, exceeding the performance of human annotators, leading to efforts to replace or augment the benchmark with more challenging tasks. In addition, there are cases of \"shortcut learning\" wherein AIs sometimes \"cheat\" on multiple-choice tests by using statistical correlations in superficial test question wording in order to guess the correct responses, without necessarily understanding the actual question being asked.Some datasets have been constructed adversarially, focusing on particular problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually",
    "problems on which extant language models seem to have unusually poor performance compared to humans. One example is the TruthfulQA dataset, a question answering dataset consisting of 817 questions which language models are susceptible to answering incorrectly by mimicking falsehoods to which they were repeatedly exposed during training. For example, an LLM may answer \"No\" to the question \"Can you teach an old dog new tricks?\" because of its exposure to the English idiom you can't teach an old dog new tricks, even though this is not literally true.Another example of an adversarial evaluation dataset is Swag and its successor, HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options",
    "HellaSwag, collections of problems in which one of multiple options must be selected to complete a text passage. The incorrect completions were generated by sampling from a language model and filtering with a set of classifiers. The resulting problems are trivial for humans but at the time the datasets were created state of the art language models had poor accuracy on them. For example: We see a fitness center sign. We then see a man talking to the camera and sitting and laying on a exercise ball. The man... a) demonstrates how to increase efficient exercise work by running up and down balls. b) moves all his arms and legs",
    "and down balls. b) moves all his arms and legs and builds up a lot of muscle. c) then plays the ball and we see a graphics and hedge trimming demonstration. d) performs sit ups while on the ball and talking. BERT selects b) as the most likely completion, though the correct answer is d). == Wider impact == In 2023, Nature Biomedical Engineering wrote that \"it is no longer possible to accurately distinguish\" human-written text from text created by large language models, and that \"It is all but certain that general-purpose large language models will rapidly proliferate... It is a rather safe bet that they will change many industries",
    "a rather safe bet that they will change many industries over time.\" Goldman Sachs suggested in 2023 that generative language AI could increase global GDP by 7% in the next ten years, and could expose to automation 300 million jobs globally. === Copyright === Memorization is an emergent behavior in LLMs in which long strings of text are occasionally output verbatim from training data, contrary to typical behavior of traditional artificial neural nets. Evaluations of controlled LLM output measure the amount memorized from training data (focused on GPT-2-series models) as variously over 1% for exact duplicates or up to about 7%. === Security === Some commenters expressed concern over accidental",
    "7%. === Security === Some commenters expressed concern over accidental or deliberate creation of misinformation, or other forms of misuse. For example, the availability of large language models could reduce the skill-level required to commit bioterrorism; biosecurity researcher Kevin Esvelt has suggested that LLM creators should exclude from their training data papers on creating or enhancing pathogens.A study by researchers at Google and several universities, including Cornell University and University of California, Berkeley, showed that there are potential security risks in language models such as ChatGPT. In their study, they examined the possibility that questioners could get, from ChatGPT, the training data that the AI model used; they found that",
    "training data that the AI model used; they found that they could get the training data from the AI model. For example, when asking ChatGPT 3.5 turbo to repeat the word \"poem\" forever, the AI model will say \"poem\" hundreds of times and then diverge, deviating from the standard dialogue style and spitting out nonsense phrases, thus spitting out the training data as it is. The researchers have seen more than 10,000 examples of the AI model exposing their training data in a similar method. The researchers said that it was hard to tell if the AI model was actually safe or not.The potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLM",
    "safe or not.The potential presence of \"sleeper agents\" within LLM models is another emerging security concern. These are hidden functionalities built into the model that remain dormant until triggered by a specific event or condition. Upon activation, the LLM deviates from its expected behavior to make insecure actions. === Algorithmic bias === While LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, they are susceptible to inheriting and amplifying biases present in their training data. This can manifest in skewed representations or unfair treatment of different demographics, such as those based on race, gender, language, and cultural groups. Since English data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data,",
    "data is overrepresented in current large language models' training data, it may also downplay non-English views. ==== Stereotyping ==== AI models can reinforce a wide range of stereotypes, including those based on gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, religion, or occupation. This can lead to outputs that unfairly generalize or caricature groups of people, sometimes in harmful or derogatory ways.Notably, gender bias refers to the tendency of these models to produce outputs that are unfairly prejudiced towards one gender over another. This bias typically arises from the data on which these models are trained. Large language models often assign roles and characteristics based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate",
    "based on traditional gender norms. For example, it might associate nurses or secretaries predominantly with women and engineers or CEOs with men. ==== Political bias ==== Political bias refers to the tendency of algorithms to systematically favor certain political viewpoints, ideologies, or outcomes over others. Language models may also exhibit political biases. Since the training data includes a wide range of political opinions and coverage, the models might generate responses that lean towards particular political ideologies or viewpoints, depending on the prevalence of those views in the data. == List == For the training cost column, 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP/sec \u00d7 1 day = 8.64E19 FLOP. == See also",

    "A foundation model is a machine learning model that is trained on broad data such that it can be applied across a wide range of use cases. Foundation models have transformed artificial intelligence (AI), powering prominent generative AI applications like ChatGPT. The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) created and popularized the term.Foundation models are general-purpose technologies that can support a diverse range of use cases.

Early examples of foundation models were language models (LMs) like Google's BERT and OpenAI's \"GPT-n\" series. Beyond text, foundation models have been developed across a range of modalities\u2014including DALL-E and Flamingo for images, MusicGen for music, and RT-2 for robotic control. Foundation models constitute a broad shift in AI development: foundation models are being built for astronomy, radiology, genomics, music, coding, and mathematics. == Definitions == The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation",

This was based on their observation that preexisting terms, while overlapping, were not adequate, stating that \"'(large) language model' was too narrow given [the] focus is not only language; 'self-supervised model' was too specific to the training objective; and 'pretrained model' suggested that the noteworthy action all happened after 'pretraining.\" The term \u201cfoundation model\u201d was chosen over \u201cfoundational model\u201d because \u201cfoundational\u201d implies",

After considering many terms, they settled on \"foundation model\" to emphasize the intended function (i.e., amenability to subsequent further development) rather than modality, architecture, or implementation. As governments regulate foundation models, new legal definitions have emerged. In the United States, the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence defines a foundation model as \u201can AI model that is trained on broad data; generally uses self-supervision; contains at least tens of billions of parameters; is applicable across a wide range of",

For example, the U.S. definitions are the sole definitions to make reference to the size of a foundation model, though they differ on an exact magnitude. Beyer and Eshoo's definition also specifies that foundation models must achieve a level of performance as to be a potential danger. In contrast, the E.U. definition includes mention of whether the model is designed for generality of output. Nonetheless, all definitions share that foundation models must be trained on a broad range of data with potential applications in many domains. == History of Foundation Models == Technologically, foundation models are built",
    "History of Foundation Models == Technologically, foundation models are built using established machine learning techniques like deep neural networks, transfer learning, and self-supervised learning. Foundation models are noteworthy given the unprecedented resource investment, model and data size, and ultimately their scope of application when compared to previous forms of AI. The rise of foundation models constitutes a new paradigm in AI, where general-purpose models function as a reusable infrastructure, instead of bespoke and one-off task-specific models. Foundation models draw upon a series of advances in the history of AI. These models can be situated against the backdrop of the broader rise of machine learning since the 1990s. Prior AI models",
    "rise of machine learning since the 1990s. Prior AI models depended on specific instructions to solve a given task, but machine learning-powered models were able to decipher what task to solve given sufficient data. Such a shift from so-called expert systems to data-driven machine learning was the first step towards the modern foundation model. The next major step was the advent of deep learning circa 2010. With larger datasets and more advanced neural networks, AI models were able to achieve higher levels of performance. The first major instance of deep learning was exhibited by the model architecture AlexNet, which won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. AlexNet exhibited",
    "the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. AlexNet exhibited strong performance on a large-scale general dataset, and first proved that deep learning was possible. Alongside the methodological shift to end-to-end optimization of deep neural networks, the 2010s was also marked by a software shift. In the mid 2010s, the rise of deep learning frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow provided crucial infrastructure for simplifying and scaling deep learning pipelines. Foundation models began to materialize as the latest wave of deep learning models in the late 2010s with models like ELMo, GPT, BERT and GPT-2. Relative to most prior work on deep learning, these language models demonstrated the potential of training",
    "deep learning, these language models demonstrated the potential of training on much large web-sourced datasets using self-supervised objectives (e.g. predicting the next word in a large corpus of text). These approaches, which draw upon earlier works like word2vec and GloVe, deviated from prior supervised approaches that required annotated data (e.g. crowd-sources labels). Overall, the computational advances in specialized hardware and parallelism (e.g., large clusters of NVIDIA GPUs), new developments in neural network architecture (e.g., the Transformer), and the increased use of training data with minimal supervision all contributed to the rise of foundation models. Some noteworthy foundation models include: GPT, BERT, GPT-2, T5, GPT-3, CLIP, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, GPT-4, LLaMA,",
    "BERT, GPT-2, T5, GPT-3, CLIP, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, GPT-4, LLaMA, LLaMA 2, and Mistral. Each of these models came with its own unique abilities, particularly in their strong generative capabilities. In particular, 2022 was particularly influential in the history of foundation models. The releases of Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT (initially powered by the GPT-3.5 model) led to foundation models and generative AI entering widespread public discourse. Further, releases of LLaMA, Llama 2, and Mistral in 2023 contributed to a greater emphasis placed on how foundation models are released with open foundation models garnering a lot of support and scrutiny. == Related Concepts == === Frontier Models === Certain highly advanced",
    "Related Concepts == === Frontier Models === Certain highly advanced foundation models are termed \u201cfrontier models,\u201d which have the potential to \u201cpossess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety.\u201d These \u201cdangerous capabilities\u201d stem from the accidental or intentional misuse of such models, which in conjunction with their powerful nature can lead to severe harms. As foundation models continue to improve, some AI researchers speculate that almost all next-generation foundation models will be considered frontier models. Since the concept of dangerous capabilities is inherently subjective, there is no strict designation for what foundation models qualify as frontier models. However, some generally held ideas for sufficiently dangerous capabilities include:",

Because of their emergent nature, new dangerous capabilities can appear on their own in frontier models, both in the development stage and after being deployed. Additionally, since frontier models continue to adapt after deployment, it remains difficult to mitigate all harms that arise from already-deployed models. If a frontier model happens to be open-source or is",
    "If a frontier model happens to be open-source or is released online, the model can also disseminate rapidly, further hampering regulators by creating a lack of accountability. === General Purpose AI === Due to their adaptability to a wide range of use-cases, foundation models are sometimes considered to be examples of general-purpose AI. In designing the EU AI Act, the European Parliament has stated that a new wave of general-purpose AI technologies shapes the overall AI ecosystem. The fuller structure of the ecosystem, in addition to the properties of specific general-purpose AI systems, influences the design of AI policy and research. General-purpose AI systems also often appear in people\u2019s everyday",

Government agencies like EU Parliament have identified regulation general-purpose AI, such as foundation models, to be a high priority. General-purpose AI systems are often characterized by large size, opacity, and potential for emergence, all of which can create unintended harms. Such systems also heavily influence downstream applications, which further exacerbates the need for regulation. In regards to prominent legislation, a number of stakeholders have pushed for the EU AI Act to include restrictions on general-purpose AI systems, all of which would also apply to foundation models. == Technical Details == ===",
    "also apply to foundation models. == Technical Details == === Modeling === For a foundation model to effectively generalize, it must acquire rich representations of the training data. As a result, expressive model architectures that efficiently process large-scale data are often preferred in building foundation models. Currently, the Transformer architecture is the de facto choice for building foundation models across a range of modalities. === Training === Foundation models are built by optimizing a training objective(s), which is a mathematical function that determines how model parameters are updated based on model predictions on training data. Language models are often trained with a next-tokens prediction objective, which refers to the extent",
    "with a next-tokens prediction objective, which refers to the extent at which the model is able to predict the next token in a sequence. Image models are commonly trained with contrastive learning or diffusion training objectives. For contrastive learning, images are randomly augmented before being evaluated on the resulting similarity of the model\u2019s representations. For diffusion models, images are noised and the model learns to gradually de-noise via the objective. Multimodal training objectives also exist, with some separating images and text during training, while others examine them concurrently. In general, the training objectives for foundation models promote the learning of broadly useful representations of data. With the rise of foundation",
    "broadly useful representations of data. With the rise of foundation models and the larger datasets that power them, a training objective must be able to parse through internet-scale data for meaningful data points. Additionally, since foundation models are designed to solve a general range of tasks, training objectives ought to be domain complete, or able to solve a broad set of downstream capabilities within the given domain. Lastly, foundation model training objectives should seek to scale well and be computationally efficient. With model size and compute power both being relevant constraints, a training objective must be able to overcome such bottlenecks. === Data === Foundation models are trained on a",
    "bottlenecks. === Data === Foundation models are trained on a large quantity of data, working under the maxim \u201cthe more data, the better.\u201d Performance evaluation does show that more data generally leads to better performance, but other issues arise as data quantity grows. Tasks like managing the dataset, integrating data across new applications, ensuring adherence to data licenses, and maintaining data quality all become more difficult as data size grows. The specific demands of foundation models have only exacerbated such issues, as it remains the norm for large foundation models to use public web-scraped data. Public web data remains a plentiful resource, but it also demands stringent moderation and data",
    "plentiful resource, but it also demands stringent moderation and data processing from foundation model developers before it can be successfully integrated into the training pipeline.Training foundation models often runs the risk of violating user privacy, as private data can be disclosed, collected, or used in ways beyond the stated scope. Even if no private data is leaked, models can still inadvertently compromise security through learned behavior in the resulting foundation model. Data quality is another key point, as web-scraped data frequently contains biased, duplicate, and toxic material. Once foundation models are deployed, ensuring high-quality data is still an issue, as undesirable behavior can still emerge from small subsets of data.",
    "undesirable behavior can still emerge from small subsets of data. === Systems === The size of foundation models also brings about issues with the computer systems they run on. The average foundation model is too large to be run within a single accelerator\u2019s memory and the initial training process requires an expensive amount of resources. Such issues are predicted to further exacerbate in future as foundation models grow to new heights. Due to this constraint, researchers have begun looking into compressing model size through tight model inference. GPUs are the most common choice of compute hardware for machine learning, due to high memory storage and strong power. Typical foundation model",
    "to high memory storage and strong power. Typical foundation model training requires many GPUs, all connected in parallel with fast interconnects. Acquiring a sufficient amount of GPUs of requisite compute efficiency is a challenge for many foundation model developers, one that has led to an increasing dilemma in the field. Larger models require greater compute power, but often at the cost of improved compute efficiency. Since training remains time-consuming and expensive, the tradeoff between compute power and compute efficiency has led only a few select companies to afford the production costs for large, state of the art foundation models. Some techniques like compression and distillation can make inference more affordable,",
    "techniques like compression and distillation can make inference more affordable, but they fail to completely shore up this weakness. === Scaling === The accuracy and capabilities of foundation models often scale predictably with the size of the model and the amount of the training data. Specifically, scaling laws have been discovered, which are data-based empirical trends that relate resources (data, model size, compute usage) to model capabilities. Particularly, a model\u2019s scale is defined by compute, dataset size, and the number of parameters, all of which exhibit a power-law relationship with end performance. However, broken scaling laws have been discovered in which this relationship smoothly transitions (at points referred to as",
    "which this relationship smoothly transitions (at points referred to as break(s)) from a power law with one exponent to a power law with another (different) exponent. When one does not collect any points near (or after) the break(s), it can be difficult to obtain an accurate extrapolation. === Adaptation === Foundation models are inherently multi-purpose: to use these model for a specific use case requires some form of adaptation. At a minimum, models need to be adapted to perform the task of interest (task specification), but often better performance can be achieved by more extensive adaptation to the domain of interest (domain specialization). A variety of methods (e.g. prompting, in-context",
    "interest (domain specialization). A variety of methods (e.g. prompting, in-context learning, fine-tuning, LoRA) provide different tradeoffs between the costs of adaptation and the extent to which models are specialized. Some major facets to consider when adapting a foundation model are compute budget and data availability. Foundation models can be very large, up to trillions of parameters in size, so adapting the entirety of a foundation model can be computationally expensive. Therefore, developers sometimes adapt only the last neural layer or only the bias vectors to save time and space. For particularly niche applications, specific data may also not be available to adapt the foundation model sufficiently. In such circumstances, data",
    "to adapt the foundation model sufficiently. In such circumstances, data must be manually labeled, which is costly and can demand expert knowledge. === Evaluation === Evaluation is a key part of developing foundation models. Not only does evaluation allow for tracking progress of high-performance models, it also creates benchmarks for future model development. Stakeholders rely on evaluations to understand model behaviors and gain insight into their various attributes. Traditionally, foundation models are evaluated relative to each other through standardized task benchmarks like MMLU, MMMU, HumanEval, and GSM8K. Given that foundation models are multi-purpose, increasingly meta-benchmarks are developed that aggregate different underlying benchmarks. Examples include LM-Harness, BIG-Bench, HELM, OpenLLM Leaderboard, DecodingTrust,",
    "underlying benchmarks. Examples include LM-Harness, BIG-Bench, HELM, OpenLLM Leaderboard, DecodingTrust, and HEIM. Since foundation models\u2019 utility depends on their own general capabilities and the performance of fine-tuned applications, evaluation must cover both metrics. Proper evaluation examines both a foundation model\u2019s downstream applications in aggregate and the direct properties the foundation model holds. To ensure further equity in evaluation, certain existing evaluation frameworks account for all adaptation resources, which leads to more informed analyses for the benefit of all stakeholders. == Supply Chain == Foundation models\u2019 general capabilities allow them to fulfill a unique role in the AI ecosystem, fueled by many upstream and downstream technologies. Training a foundation model requires",
    "many upstream and downstream technologies. Training a foundation model requires several resources (e.g. data, compute, labor, hardware, code), with foundation models often involving immense amounts of data and compute (also referred to as computational power). Due to foundation models\u2019 large development costs and inexpensive adaptation requirements, the AI landscape has shifted to a small subset of AI companies making foundation models for downstream adaptation. Thus, most foundation model companies outsource this step to specialized data providers (e.g. Scale AI, Surge) and compute providers (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure). The foundation model developer itself will then take the data and use the supplied compute to actually train the",
    "data and use the supplied compute to actually train the foundation model. After the foundation model is completely built, much of the data and labor requirements abate. In this development process, hardware and compute are the most necessary, and also the most exclusive resources. To train larger and more complex AI, a sufficient amount of compute is key. However, compute is consolidated in the hands of a few, select entities, which most foundation model developers depend on. As such, the foundation model pipeline is concentrated heavily around these providers. Compute is also costly; in 2023, AI companies spent more than 80% of total capital on compute resources.Foundation models require a",

Early foundation models scraped from subsets of the internet to provide this data information. As the size and scope of foundation models grows, larger quantities of internet scraping becomes necessary, resulting in higher likelihoods of biased or toxic data. This toxic or biased data can disproportionately harm marginalized groups and exacerbate existing prejudices.To address this issue of low-quality data that arose with unsupervised training, some foundation model developers have turned to manual filtering. This practice, known as data labor, comes with its own host of issues. Such manual data detoxification is",
    "its own host of issues. Such manual data detoxification is often outsourced to reduce labor costs, with some workers making less than $2 per hour.The foundation model will then be hosted online either via the developer or via an external organization. Once released, other parties can create applications based on the foundation model, whether through fine-tuning or wholly new purposes. People can then access these applications to serve their various means, allowing one foundation model to power and reach a wide audience. == Release Strategies == After a foundation model is built, it can be released in one of many ways. There are many facets to a release: the asset",
    "ways. There are many facets to a release: the asset itself, who has access, how access changes over time, and the conditions on use. All these factors contribute to how a foundation model will affect downstream applications. In particular, the two most common forms of foundation model release are through APIs and direct model downloads. When a model is released via an API, users can query the model and receive responses, but cannot directly access the model itself. Comparatively, the model could be directly downloadable for users to access and modify. Both release strategies are often classified as an open release. The exact definition of an open release is disputed,",

Some open foundation models are: GPT-4, PaLM 2, Llama 2, and Mistral. While open foundation models can further research and development more easily, they are also more susceptible to misuse. Open foundation models can be downloaded by anyone, and particularly powerful models can be fine-tuned to intentionally or unintentionally cause harm. During a closed release, the foundation model cannot be accessed by the public, but is used internally by an organization. Such releases are considered safer, but offer no additional value to the research community or the public at",

From another angle to view deep learning, deep learning refers to \"computer-simulate\" or \"automate\" human learning processes from a source (e.g., an image of dogs) to a learned object (dogs). Therefore, a notion coined as \"deeper\" learning or \"deepest\" learning makes sense. The deepest learning refers to the fully automatic learning from a source to a final learned object. A deeper learning thus refers to a mixed learning process: a human learning process from a source to a learned semi-object, followed by a computer learning process from the human learned",

In an image recognition application, the raw input may be a matrix of pixels; the first representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the",
    "representational layer may abstract the pixels and encode edges; the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges; the third layer may encode a nose and eyes; and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face. Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own. This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.The word \"deep\" in \"deep learning\" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP)",
    "deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized). For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited. No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. CAP",
    "that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. CAP of depth 2 has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function. Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network. Deep models (CAP > 2) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively. Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method. Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.For supervised learning tasks, deep learning methods enable elimination of feature engineering, by translating the data into",

Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks. This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data. Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks.Machine learning models are now adept at identifying complex patterns in financial market data.

Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima's rectified linear unit.The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the",

Lu et al. proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator. The probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning. It features inference, as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively. More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution",

RNNs have cycles in their connectivity structure, FNNs don't. In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created and analyzed the Ising model which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements.

Instead, subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique.

Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation already in 1960 in the context of control theory. In 1982, Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to MLPs in the way that has become standard.

CNNs have become an essential tool for computer vision. The term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons.In 1988, Wei Zhang et al. applied the backpropagation algorithm to",

To overcome this problem, J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber (1992) proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning.

This has become the most cited neural network of the 21st century.In 1994, Andr\u00e9 de Carvalho, together with Mike Fairhurst and David Bisset, published experimental results of a multi-layer boolean neural network, also known as a weightless neural network, composed of a 3-layers self-organising feature extraction neural network module (SOFT) followed by a multi-layer classification neural network module (GSN), which were independently trained. Each layer in the feature extraction module extracted features with growing complexity regarding the previous layer.In 1995, Brendan Frey demonstrated that it was possible to train (over two days) a network containing six fully connected layers and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed",
    "and several hundred hidden units using the wake-sleep algorithm, co-developed with Peter Dayan and Hinton.Since 1997, Sven Behnke extended the feed-forward hierarchical convolutional approach in the Neural Abstraction Pyramid by lateral and backward connections in order to flexibly incorporate context into decisions and iteratively resolve local ambiguities. Simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) were a popular choice in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks. Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many",
    "of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years. These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively. Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models. Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power. Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling. An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s. Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI studied deep neural networks (DNNs) in speech and speaker recognition. The speaker recognition team led by Larry",

The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 National Institute of Standards and Technology Speaker Recognition evaluation. The SRI deep neural network was then deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning. The principle of elevating \"raw\" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the \"raw\" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms.

    "The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.Speech recognition was taken over by LSTM. In 2003, LSTM started to become competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks. In 2006, Alex Graves, Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) in stacks of LSTM RNNs. In 2015, Google's speech recognition reportedly experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through CTC-trained LSTM, which they made available through Google Voice Search.The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. Industrial",
    "checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun. Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010. In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero and Teh showed how a many-layered feedforward neural network could be effectively pre-trained one layer at a time, treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted Boltzmann machine, then fine-tuning it using supervised backpropagation. The papers referred to learning for deep belief nets. The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural",
    "more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical. It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets. However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems. The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly",
    "into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems. Analysis around 2009\u20132010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs. DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition. That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models. In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees.Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech",
    "systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved. Convolutional neural networks were superseded for ASR by CTC for LSTM. but are more successful in computer vision. Advances in hardware have driven renewed interest in deep learning. In 2009, Nvidia was involved in what was called the \"big bang\" of deep learning, \"as deep-learning neural networks were trained with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs)\". That year, Andrew Ng determined that GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about",
    "GPUs could increase the speed of deep-learning systems by about 100 times. In particular, GPUs are well-suited for the matrix/vector computations involved in machine learning. GPUs speed up training algorithms by orders of magnitude, reducing running times from weeks to days. Further, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations can be used for efficient processing of deep learning models. === Deep learning revolution === In the late 2000s, deep learning started to outperform other methods in machine learning competitions. In 2009, a long short-term memory trained by connectionist temporal classification (Alex Graves, Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez, Faustino Gomez, and J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, 2006) was the first RNN to win pattern recognition contests, winning three competitions",
    "first RNN to win pattern recognition contests, winning three competitions in connected handwriting recognition. Google later used CTC-trained LSTM for speech recognition on the smartphone.Significant impacts in image or object recognition were felt from 2011 to 2012. Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades, and GPU implementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision. In 2011, the DanNet by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella, and J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3. Also in 2011,",
    "traditional methods by a factor of 3. Also in 2011, DanNet won the ICDAR Chinese handwriting contest, and in May 2012, it won the ISBI image segmentation contest. Until 2011, CNNs did not play a major role at computer vision conferences, but in June 2012, a paper by Ciresan et al. at the leading conference CVPR showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU can dramatically improve many vision benchmark records. In September 2012, DanNet also won the ICPR contest on analysis of large medical images for cancer detection, and in the following year also the MICCAI Grand Challenge on the same topic. In October 2012, the similar AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky,",
    "topic. In October 2012, the similar AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods. The VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman further reduced the error rate and won the ImageNet 2014 competition, following a similar trend in large-scale speech recognition. Image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.In 2012, a team led by George E. Dahl won the \"Merck Molecular Activity Challenge\" using multi-task deep neural networks to predict the biomolecular target of one drug. In 2014,",
    "to predict the biomolecular target of one drug. In 2014, Sepp Hochreiter's group used deep learning to detect off-target and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs and won the \"Tox21 Data Challenge\" of NIH, FDA and NCATS.In 2016, Roger Parloff mentioned a \"deep learning revolution\" that has transformed the AI industry.In March 2019, Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the Turing Award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing. == Neural networks == Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.",
    "inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as \"cat\" or \"no cat\" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons",
    "neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The",

Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite",
    "to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing \"Go\"). === Deep neural networks === A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers. There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions. These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be",
    "that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name \"deep\" networks. DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition",
    "models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives. The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets. DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output",
    "which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or \"weights\", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights. That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data. Recurrent neural networks, in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling. Long short-term memory is",
    "for applications such as language modeling. Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision. CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR). ==== Challenges ==== As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs. Two common issues are overfitting and computation time. DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data. Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning or weight decay ( \u2113 2 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}} -regularization) or sparsity ( \u2113 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} -regularization) can be applied",
    "( \u2113 1 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{1}} -regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting. Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training. This helps to exclude rare dependencies. Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting.DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate, and initial weights. Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as",
    "cost in time and computational resources. Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) speed up computation. Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms. CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neural network. It doesn't require learning rates or randomized initial weights. The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with",
    "process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved. == Hardware == Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer. By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI. OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet",
    "computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform. Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2).Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep",

Feldmann et al. proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing.

LSTM RNNs can learn \"Very Deep Learning\" tasks that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms. LSTM with forget gates is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT.

    "on TIMIT. The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English, where each speaker reads 10 sentences. Its small size lets many configurations be tried. More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone-sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models. This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed. The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.

MNIST is composed of handwritten digits and includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. As with TIMIT, its small size lets users test multiple configurations. A comprehensive list of results on this set is available.Deep learning-based image recognition has become \"superhuman\", producing more accurate results than human contestants.

LSTM helped to improve machine translation and language modeling.Other key techniques in this field are negative sampling and word embedding. Word embedding, such as word2vec, can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space. Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to",

Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, spoken language understanding, machine translation, contextual entity linking, writing style recognition, named-entity recognition (token classification), text classification, and others.Recent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding.

It translates \"whole sentences at a time, rather than pieces\". Google Translate supports over one hundred languages. The network encodes the \"semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations\". GT uses English as an intermediate between most language pairs. === Drug discovery and toxicology === A large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval.

Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable. Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X. For example, in image",

In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y. NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions, such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds. It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes. === Medical image analysis === Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer",

These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models,",

These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models. Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers. This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment. A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain",

A 1995 description stated, \"...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ... different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature\".A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective. On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism. Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks, may be",

In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported. For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons and neural populations. Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system both at the single-unit and at the population levels. == Commercial activity ==",

Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box, with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.Others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI, not as an all-encompassing solution. Despite the power of deep learning methods, they still lack much of the functionality needed to realize this goal entirely. Research psychologist Gary Marcus noted: Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines. Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (...) have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are",
    "no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used. The most powerful A.I. systems, like Watson (...) use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning. In further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy, a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep (20-30 layers) neural networks attempting to discern",
    "states of deep (20-30 layers) neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained demonstrate a visual appeal: the original research notice received well over 1,000 comments, and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on The Guardian's website. === Errors === Some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors, such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images (2014) and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images (2013). Goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous",
    "representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component artificial general intelligence (AGI) architectures. These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar decompositions of observed entities and events. Learning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition and artificial intelligence (AI). === Cyber threat === As deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception.",
    "that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception. By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize. For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target. Such manipulation is termed an \"adversarial attack\".In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal points, and thereby generate images that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to",
    "that deceived it. The modified images looked no different to human eyes. Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system. One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it. A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.Another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another. In 2017 researchers added stickers to stop",
    "to impersonate another. In 2017 researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ANN to misclassify them.ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry. ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.In 2016, another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the Google Now voice command system open a particular web address, and hypothesized that this could",
    "open a particular web address, and hypothesized that this could \"serve as a stepping stone for further attacks (e.g., opening a web page hosting drive-by malware)\".In \"data poisoning\", false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system's training set to prevent it from achieving mastery. === Data collection ethics === Most Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated by humans. It has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-paid clickwork (e.g. on Amazon Mechanical Turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose, but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such.

The philosopher Rainer M\u00fchlhoff distinguishes five types of \"machinic capture\" of human microwork to generate training data: (1) gamification (the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game), (2) \"trapping and tracking\" (e.g. CAPTCHAs for image recognition or click-tracking on Google search results pages), (3) exploitation of social motivations (e.g. tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images), (4) information mining (e.g. by leveraging quantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and (5) clickwork.M\u00fchlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning such as Facebook's face recognition system, the need for training data does not stop once an ANN",

For this purpose, Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image, they receive a notification. They can choose whether or not they like to be publicly labeled on the image, or tell Facebook that it is not them in the picture.

DBMSs may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions.Since DBMSs comprise a significant market, computer and storage vendors often take into account DBMS requirements in their own development plans.Databases and DBMSs can be categorized according to the database model(s) that they support (such as relational or XML), the type(s) of computer they run on (from a server cluster to a mobile phone), the query language(s) used to access the database (such as SQL or XQuery),",
    "used to access the database (such as SQL or XQuery), and their internal engineering, which affects performance, scalability, resilience, and security. == History == The sizes, capabilities, and performance of databases and their respective DBMSs have grown in orders of magnitude. These performance increases were enabled by the technology progress in the areas of processors, computer memory, computer storage, and computer networks. The concept of a database was made possible by the emergence of direct access storage media such as magnetic disks, which became widely available in the mid-1960s; earlier systems relied on sequential storage of data on magnetic tape. The subsequent development of database technology can be divided into",
    "The subsequent development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure: navigational, SQL/relational, and post-relational. The two main early navigational data models were the hierarchical model and the CODASYL model (network model). These were characterized by the use of pointers (often physical disk addresses) to follow relationships from one record to another. The relational model, first proposed in 1970 by Edgar F. Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did",
    "a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and as of 2018 they remain dominant: IBM Db2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft SQL Server are the most searched DBMS. The dominant database language, standardized SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.Object databases were developed in the 1980s to overcome the inconvenience of object\u2013relational impedance mismatch, which led to the coining of the term \"post-relational\" and also the development of hybrid object\u2013relational databases. The",

The next generation of post-relational databases in the late 2000s became known as NoSQL databases, introducing fast key\u2013value stores and document-oriented databases. A competing \"next generation\" known as NewSQL databases attempted new implementations that retained the relational/SQL model while aiming to match the high performance of NoSQL compared to commercially available relational DBMSs. === 1960s, navigational DBMS === The introduction of the term database coincided with the availability of direct-access storage (disks and drums) from the mid-1960s onwards. The term represented a contrast with the tape-based systems of the past, allowing shared interactive use rather than daily batch processing. The Oxford",
    "shared interactive use rather than daily batch processing. The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1962 report by the System Development Corporation of California as the first to use the term \"data-base\" in a specific technical sense.As computers grew in speed and capability, a number of general-purpose database systems emerged; by the mid-1960s a number of such systems had come into commercial use. Interest in a standard began to grow, and Charles Bachman, author of one such product, the Integrated Data Store (IDS), founded the Database Task Group within CODASYL, the group responsible for the creation and standardization of COBOL. In 1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally",
    "1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally became known as the CODASYL approach, and soon a number of commercial products based on this approach entered the market. The CODASYL approach offered applications the ability to navigate around a linked data set which was formed into a large network. Applications could find records by one of three methods: Use of a primary key (known as a CALC key, typically implemented by hashing) Navigating relationships (called sets) from one record to another Scanning all the records in a sequential orderLater systems added B-trees to provide alternate access paths. Many CODASYL databases also added a declarative query language for end",
    "CODASYL databases also added a declarative query language for end users (as distinct from the navigational API). However, CODASYL databases were complex and required significant training and effort to produce useful applications. IBM also had its own DBMS in 1966, known as Information Management System (IMS). IMS was a development of software written for the Apollo program on the System/360. IMS was generally similar in concept to CODASYL, but used a strict hierarchy for its model of data navigation instead of CODASYL's network model. Both concepts later became known as navigational databases due to the way data was accessed: the term was popularized by Bachman's 1973 Turing Award presentation The",
    "term was popularized by Bachman's 1973 Turing Award presentation The Programmer as Navigator. IMS is classified by IBM as a hierarchical database. IDMS and Cincom Systems' TOTAL databases are classified as network databases. IMS remains in use as of 2014. === 1970s, relational DBMS === Edgar F. Codd worked at IBM in San Jose, California, in one of their offshoot offices that were primarily involved in the development of hard disk systems. He was unhappy with the navigational model of the CODASYL approach, notably the lack of a \"search\" facility. In 1970, he wrote a number of papers that outlined a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in",
    "a new approach to database construction that eventually culminated in the groundbreaking A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.In this paper, he described a new system for storing and working with large databases. Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to organize the data as a number of \"tables\", each table being used for a different type of entity. Each table would contain a fixed number of columns containing the attributes of the entity. One or more columns of each table were designated as a primary key by which the rows of the table",
    "a primary key by which the rows of the table could be uniquely identified; cross-references between tables always used these primary keys, rather than disk addresses, and queries would join tables based on these key relationships, using a set of operations based on the mathematical system of relational calculus (from which the model takes its name). Splitting the data into a set of normalized tables (or relations) aimed to ensure that each \"fact\" was only stored once, thus simplifying update operations. Virtual tables called views could present the data in different ways for different users, but views could not be directly updated. Codd used mathematical terms to define the model:",
    "directly updated. Codd used mathematical terms to define the model: relations, tuples, and domains rather than tables, rows, and columns. The terminology that is now familiar came from early implementations. Codd would later criticize the tendency for practical implementations to depart from the mathematical foundations on which the model was based. The use of primary keys (user-oriented identifiers) to represent cross-table relationships, rather than disk addresses, had two primary motivations. From an engineering perspective, it enabled tables to be relocated and resized without expensive database reorganization. But Codd was more interested in the difference in semantics: the use of explicit identifiers made it easier to define update operations with clean",
    "identifiers made it easier to define update operations with clean mathematical definitions, and it also enabled query operations to be defined in terms of the established discipline of first-order predicate calculus; because these operations have clean mathematical properties, it becomes possible to rewrite queries in provably correct ways, which is the basis of query optimization. There is no loss of expressiveness compared with the hierarchic or network models, though the connections between tables are no longer so explicit. In the hierarchic and network models, records were allowed to have a complex internal structure. For example, the salary history of an employee might be represented as a \"repeating group\" within the",
    "employee might be represented as a \"repeating group\" within the employee record. In the relational model, the process of normalization led to such internal structures being replaced by data held in multiple tables, connected only by logical keys. For instance, a common use of a database system is to track information about users, their name, login information, various addresses and phone numbers. In the navigational approach, all of this data would be placed in a single variable-length record. In the relational approach, the data would be normalized into a user table, an address table and a phone number table (for instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only",
    "instance). Records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided. As well as identifying rows/records using logical identifiers rather than disk addresses, Codd changed the way in which applications assembled data from multiple records. Rather than requiring applications to gather data one record at a time by navigating the links, they would use a declarative query language that expressed what data was required, rather than the access path by which it should be found. Finding an efficient access path to the data became the responsibility of the database management system, rather than the application programmer. This process, called query optimization, depended",
    "than the application programmer. This process, called query optimization, depended on the fact that queries were expressed in terms of mathematical logic. Codd's paper was picked up by two people at Berkeley, Eugene Wong and Michael Stonebraker. They started a project known as INGRES using funding that had already been allocated for a geographical database project and student programmers to produce code. Beginning in 1973, INGRES delivered its first test products which were generally ready for widespread use in 1979. INGRES was similar to System R in a number of ways, including the use of a \"language\" for data access, known as QUEL. Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging",
    "known as QUEL. Over time, INGRES moved to the emerging SQL standard. IBM itself did one test implementation of the relational model, PRTV, and a production one, Business System 12, both now discontinued. Honeywell wrote MRDS for Multics, and now there are two new implementations: Alphora Dataphor and Rel. Most other DBMS implementations usually called relational are actually SQL DBMSs. In 1970, the University of Michigan began development of the MICRO Information Management System based on D.L. Childs' Set-Theoretic Data model. MICRO was used to manage very large data sets by the US Department of Labor, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and researchers from the University of Alberta, the University",
    "Agency, and researchers from the University of Alberta, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. It ran on IBM mainframe computers using the Michigan Terminal System. The system remained in production until 1998. === Integrated approach === In the 1970s and 1980s, attempts were made to build database systems with integrated hardware and software. The underlying philosophy was that such integration would provide higher performance at a lower cost. Examples were IBM System/38, the early offering of Teradata, and the Britton Lee, Inc. database machine. Another approach to hardware support for database management was ICL's CAFS accelerator, a hardware disk controller with programmable search capabilities. In the long term,",
    "disk controller with programmable search capabilities. In the long term, these efforts were generally unsuccessful because specialized database machines could not keep pace with the rapid development and progress of general-purpose computers. Thus most database systems nowadays are software systems running on general-purpose hardware, using general-purpose computer data storage. However, this idea is still pursued in certain applications by some companies like Netezza and Oracle (Exadata). === Late 1970s, SQL DBMS === IBM started working on a prototype system loosely based on Codd's concepts as System R in the early 1970s. The first version was ready in 1974/5, and work then started on multi-table systems in which the data could",
    "then started on multi-table systems in which the data could be split so that all of the data for a record (some of which is optional) did not have to be stored in a single large \"chunk\". Subsequent multi-user versions were tested by customers in 1978 and 1979, by which time a standardized query language \u2013 SQL \u2013 had been added. Codd's ideas were establishing themselves as both workable and superior to CODASYL, pushing IBM to develop a true production version of System R, known as SQL/DS, and, later, Database 2 (IBM Db2).

    "Oracle) started from a different chain, based on IBM's papers on System R. Though Oracle V1 implementations were completed in 1978, it was not until Oracle Version 2 when Ellison beat IBM to market in 1979.Stonebraker went on to apply the lessons from INGRES to develop a new database, Postgres, which is now known as PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is often used for global mission-critical applications (the .org and .info domain name registries use it as their primary data store, as do many large companies and financial institutions). In Sweden, Codd's paper was also read and Mimer SQL was developed in the mid-1970s at Uppsala University. In 1984, this project was consolidated",
    "mid-1970s at Uppsala University. In 1984, this project was consolidated into an independent enterprise. Another data model, the entity\u2013relationship model, emerged in 1976 and gained popularity for database design as it emphasized a more familiar description than the earlier relational model. Later on, entity\u2013relationship constructs were retrofitted as a data modeling construct for the relational model, and the difference between the two has become irrelevant. === 1980s, on the desktop === The 1980s ushered in the age of desktop computing. The new computers empowered their users with spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3 and database software like dBASE. The dBASE product was lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out",
    "lightweight and easy for any computer user to understand out of the box. C. Wayne Ratliff, the creator of dBASE, stated: \"dBASE was different from programs like BASIC, C, FORTRAN, and COBOL in that a lot of the dirty work had already been done. The data manipulation is done by dBASE instead of by the user, so the user can concentrate on what he is doing, rather than having to mess with the dirty details of opening, reading, and closing files, and managing space allocation.\" dBASE was one of the top selling software titles in the 1980s and early 1990s. === 1990s, object-oriented === The 1990s, along with a rise",
    "=== 1990s, object-oriented === The 1990s, along with a rise in object-oriented programming, saw a growth in how data in various databases were handled. Programmers and designers began to treat the data in their databases as objects. That is to say that if a person's data were in a database, that person's attributes, such as their address, phone number, and age, were now considered to belong to that person instead of being extraneous data. This allows for relations between data to be related to objects and their attributes and not to individual fields. The term \"object\u2013relational impedance mismatch\" described the inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object",
    "inconvenience of translating between programmed objects and database tables. Object databases and object\u2013relational databases attempt to solve this problem by providing an object-oriented language (sometimes as extensions to SQL) that programmers can use as alternative to purely relational SQL. On the programming side, libraries known as object\u2013relational mappings (ORMs) attempt to solve the same problem. === 2000s, NoSQL and NewSQL === XML databases are a type of structured document-oriented database that allows querying based on XML document attributes. XML databases are mostly used in applications where the data is conveniently viewed as a collection of documents, with a structure that can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid:",
    "can vary from the very flexible to the highly rigid: examples include scientific articles, patents, tax filings, and personnel records. NoSQL databases are often very fast, do not require fixed table schemas, avoid join operations by storing denormalized data, and are designed to scale horizontally. In recent years, there has been a strong demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance, but according to the CAP theorem, it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability, and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason, many NoSQL databases are using",
    "all three. For that reason, many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency. NewSQL is a class of modern relational databases that aims to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (read-write) workloads while still using SQL and maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system. == Use cases == Databases are used to support internal operations of organizations and to underpin online interactions with customers and suppliers (see Enterprise software).

Another way is by their application area, for example: accounting, music compositions, movies, banking, manufacturing, or insurance. A third way is by some technical aspect, such as the database structure or interface type. This section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases. An",
    "the adjectives used to characterize different kinds of databases. An in-memory database is a database that primarily resides in main memory, but is typically backed-up by non-volatile computer data storage. Main memory databases are faster than disk databases, and so are often used where response time is critical, such as in telecommunications network equipment. An active database includes an event-driven architecture which can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database. Possible uses include security monitoring, alerting, statistics gathering and authorization. Many databases provide active database features in the form of database triggers. A cloud database relies on cloud technology. Both the database and most of its DBMS reside",
    "technology. Both the database and most of its DBMS reside remotely, \"in the cloud\", while its applications are both developed by programmers and later maintained and used by end-users through a web browser and Open APIs. Data warehouses archive data from operational databases and often from external sources such as market research firms. The warehouse becomes the central source of data for use by managers and other end-users who may not have access to operational data. For example, sales data might be aggregated to weekly totals and converted from internal product codes to use UPCs so that they can be compared with ACNielsen data. Some basic and essential components of",
    "compared with ACNielsen data. Some basic and essential components of data warehousing include extracting, analyzing, and mining data, transforming, loading, and managing data so as to make them available for further use. A deductive database combines logic programming with a relational database. A distributed database is one in which both the data and the DBMS span multiple computers. A document-oriented database is designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented, or semi structured, information. Document-oriented databases are one of the main categories of NoSQL databases. An embedded database system is a DBMS which is tightly integrated with an application software that requires access to stored data in such a way that",
    "requires access to stored data in such a way that the DBMS is hidden from the application's end-users and requires little or no ongoing maintenance. End-user databases consist of data developed by individual end-users. Examples of these are collections of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, multimedia, and other files. Several products exist to support such databases. A federated database system comprises several distinct databases, each with its own DBMS. It is handled as a single database by a federated database management system (FDBMS), which transparently integrates multiple autonomous DBMSs, possibly of different types (in which case it would also be a heterogeneous database system), and provides them with an integrated conceptual view.",

Sometimes the term multi-database is used as a synonym for federated database, though it may refer to a less integrated (e.g., without an FDBMS and a managed integrated schema) group of databases that cooperate in a single application. In this case, typically middleware is used for distribution, which typically includes an atomic commit protocol (ACP), e.g., the two-phase commit protocol, to allow distributed (global) transactions across the participating databases. A graph database is a kind of NoSQL database that uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store information. General graph databases that can store any graph",
    "store information. General graph databases that can store any graph are distinct from specialized graph databases such as triplestores and network databases. An array DBMS is a kind of NoSQL DBMS that allows modeling, storage, and retrieval of (usually large) multi-dimensional arrays such as satellite images and climate simulation output. In a hypertext or hypermedia database, any word or a piece of text representing an object, e.g., another piece of text, an article, a picture, or a film, can be hyperlinked to that object. Hypertext databases are particularly useful for organizing large amounts of disparate information. For example, they are useful for organizing online encyclopedias, where users can conveniently jump",

A knowledge base (abbreviated KB, kb or \u0394) is a special kind of database for knowledge management, providing the means for the computerized collection, organization, and retrieval of knowledge. Also a collection of data representing problems with their solutions and related experiences.A mobile database can be carried on or synchronized from a mobile computing device. Operational databases store detailed data about the operations of an organization. They typically process relatively high volumes of updates using transactions.

A parallel database seeks to improve performance through parallelization for tasks such as loading data, building indexes and evaluating queries.The major parallel DBMS architectures which are induced by the underlying hardware architecture are: Shared memory architecture, where multiple processors share the main memory space, as well as other data storage. Shared disk architecture, where each processing",

Shared-nothing architecture, where each processing unit has its own main memory and other storage.Probabilistic databases employ fuzzy logic to draw inferences from imprecise data. Real-time databases process transactions fast enough for the result to come back and be acted on right away. A spatial database can store the data with multidimensional features. The queries on such data include location-based queries, like \"Where is the closest hotel in my area?\". A temporal database has built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model",
    "has built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model and a temporal version of SQL. More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time. A terminology-oriented database builds upon an object-oriented database, often customized for a specific field. An unstructured data database is intended to store in a manageable and protected way diverse objects that do not fit naturally and conveniently in common databases. It may include email messages, documents, journals, multimedia objects, etc. The name may be misleading since some objects can be highly structured. However, the entire possible object collection does not fit into a predefined structured framework. Most established DBMSs now support unstructured data in",
    "structured framework. Most established DBMSs now support unstructured data in various ways, and new dedicated DBMSs are emerging. == Database management system == Connolly and Begg define database management system (DBMS) as a \"software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database\". Examples of DBMS's include MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and Microsoft Access. The DBMS acronym is sometimes extended to indicate the underlying database model, with RDBMS for the relational, OODBMS for the object (oriented) and ORDBMS for the object\u2013relational model. Other extensions can indicate some other characteristics, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems. The functionality provided",
    "DDBMS for a distributed database management systems. The functionality provided by a DBMS can vary enormously. The core functionality is the storage, retrieval and update of data. Codd proposed the following functions and services a fully-fledged general purpose DBMS should provide: Data storage, retrieval and update User accessible catalog or data dictionary describing the metadata Support for transactions and concurrency Facilities for recovering the database should it become damaged Support for authorization of access and update of data Access support from remote locations Enforcing constraints to ensure data in the database abides by certain rulesIt is also generally to be expected the DBMS will provide a set of utilities for",
    "expected the DBMS will provide a set of utilities for such purposes as may be necessary to administer the database effectively, including import, export, monitoring, defragmentation and analysis utilities. The core part of the DBMS interacting between the database and the application interface sometimes referred to as the database engine. Often DBMSs will have configuration parameters that can be statically and dynamically tuned, for example the maximum amount of main memory on a server the database can use. The trend is to minimize the amount of manual configuration, and for cases such as embedded databases the need to target zero-administration is paramount. The large major enterprise DBMSs have tended to",

The large major enterprise DBMSs have tended to increase in size and functionality and have involved up to thousands of human years of development effort throughout their lifetime.Early multi-user DBMS typically only allowed for the application to reside on the same computer with access via terminals or terminal emulation software. The client\u2013server architecture was a development where the application resided on a client desktop and the database on a server allowing the processing to be distributed. This evolved into a multitier architecture incorporating application servers and web servers with the end user interface via a web browser with the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier.A general-purpose",
    "the database only directly connected to the adjacent tier.A general-purpose DBMS will provide public application programming interfaces (API) and optionally a processor for database languages such as SQL to allow applications to be written to interact with and manipulate the database. A special purpose DBMS may use a private API and be specifically customized and linked to a single application. For example, an email system performs many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as message insertion, message deletion, attachment handling, blocklist lookup, associating messages an email address and so forth however these functions are limited to what is required to handle email. == Application == External interaction with",
    "required to handle email. == Application == External interaction with the database will be via an application program that interfaces with the DBMS. This can range from a database tool that allows users to execute SQL queries textually or graphically, to a website that happens to use a database to store and search information. === Application program interface === A programmer will code interactions to the database (sometimes referred to as a datasource) via an application program interface (API) or via a database language. The particular API or language chosen will need to be supported by DBMS, possibly indirectly via a preprocessor or a bridging API. Some API's aim to",
    "a preprocessor or a bridging API. Some API's aim to be database independent, ODBC being a commonly known example. Other common API's include JDBC and ADO.NET. == Database languages == Database languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as sublanguages: Data control language (DCL) \u2013 controls access to data; Data definition language (DDL) \u2013 defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and the relationships among them; Data manipulation language (DML) \u2013 performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences; Data query language (DQL) \u2013 allows searching for information and computing derived information.Database languages are specific to a",
    "information and computing derived information.Database languages are specific to a particular data model. Notable examples include: SQL combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language. It was one of the first commercial languages for the relational model, although it departs in some respects from the relational model as described by Codd (for example, the rows and columns of a table can be ordered). SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. The standards have been regularly enhanced since and are supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream",
    "are supported (with varying degrees of conformance) by all mainstream commercial relational DBMSs. OQL is an object model language standard (from the Object Data Management Group). It has influenced the design of some of the newer query languages like JDOQL and EJB QL. XQuery is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as MarkLogic and eXist, by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and Db2, and also by in-memory XML processors such as Saxon. SQL/XML combines XQuery with SQL.A database language may also incorporate features like: DBMS-specific configuration and storage engine management Computations to modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and",
    "modify query results, like counting, summing, averaging, sorting, grouping, and cross-referencing Constraint enforcement (e.g. in an automotive database, only allowing one engine type per car) Application programming interface version of the query language, for programmer convenience == Storage == Database storage is the container of the physical materialization of a database. It comprises the internal (physical) level in the database architecture. It also contains all the information needed (e.g., metadata, \"data about the data\", and internal data structures) to reconstruct the conceptual level and external level from the internal level when needed. Databases as digital objects contain three layers of information which must be stored: the data, the structure, and",
    "information which must be stored: the data, the structure, and the semantics. Proper storage of all three layers is needed for future preservation and longevity of the database. Putting data into permanent storage is generally the responsibility of the database engine a.k.a. \"storage engine\". Though typically accessed by a DBMS through the underlying operating system (and often using the operating systems' file systems as intermediates for storage layout), storage properties and configuration settings are extremely important for the efficient operation of the DBMS, and thus are closely maintained by database administrators. A DBMS, while in operation, always has its database residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external",
    "residing in several types of storage (e.g., memory and external storage). The database data and the additional needed information, possibly in very large amounts, are coded into bits. Data typically reside in the storage in structures that look completely different from the way the data look at the conceptual and external levels, but in ways that attempt to optimize (the best possible) these levels' reconstruction when needed by users and programs, as well as for computing additional types of needed information from the data (e.g., when querying the database). Some DBMSs support specifying which character encoding was used to store data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same",
    "data, so multiple encodings can be used in the same database. Various low-level database storage structures are used by the storage engine to serialize the data model so it can be written to the medium of choice. Techniques such as indexing may be used to improve performance. Conventional storage is row-oriented, but there are also column-oriented and correlation databases. === Materialized views === Often storage redundancy is employed to increase performance. A common example is storing materialized views, which consist of frequently needed external views or query results. Storing such views saves the expensive computing them each time they are needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred",
    "needed. The downsides of materialized views are the overhead incurred when updating them to keep them synchronized with their original updated database data, and the cost of storage redundancy. === Replication === Occasionally a database employs storage redundancy by database objects replication (with one or more copies) to increase data availability (both to improve performance of simultaneous multiple end-user accesses to the same database object, and to provide resiliency in a case of partial failure of a distributed database). Updates of a replicated object need to be synchronized across the object copies. In many cases, the entire database is replicated. === Virtualization === With data virtualization, the data used remains",
    "=== Virtualization === With data virtualization, the data used remains in its original locations and real-time access is established to allow analytics across multiple sources. This can aid in resolving some technical difficulties such as compatibility problems when combining data from various platforms, lowering the risk of error caused by faulty data, and guaranteeing that the newest data is used. Furthermore, avoiding the creation of a new database containing personal information can make it easier to comply with privacy regulations. However, with data virtualization, the connection to all necessary data sources must be operational as there is no local copy of the data, which is one of the main drawbacks",
    "of the data, which is one of the main drawbacks of the approach. == Security == Database security deals with all various aspects of protecting the database content, its owners, and its users. It ranges from protection from intentional unauthorized database uses to unintentional database accesses by unauthorized entities (e.g., a person or a computer program). Database access control deals with controlling who (a person or a certain computer program) are allowed to access what information in the database. The information may comprise specific database objects (e.g., record types, specific records, data structures), certain computations over certain objects (e.g., query types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to",
    "types, or specific queries), or using specific access paths to the former (e.g., using specific indexes or other data structures to access information). Database access controls are set by special authorized (by the database owner) personnel that uses dedicated protected security DBMS interfaces. This may be managed directly on an individual basis, or by the assignment of individuals and privileges to groups, or (in the most elaborate models) through the assignment of individuals and groups to roles which are then granted entitlements. Data security prevents unauthorized users from viewing or updating the database. Using passwords, users are allowed access to the entire database or subsets of it called \"subschemas\". For",
    "the entire database or subsets of it called \"subschemas\". For example, an employee database can contain all the data about an individual employee, but one group of users may be authorized to view only payroll data, while others are allowed access to only work history and medical data. If the DBMS provides a way to interactively enter and update the database, as well as interrogate it, this capability allows for managing personal databases. Data security in general deals with protecting specific chunks of data, both physically (i.e., from corruption, or destruction, or removal; e.g., see physical security), or the interpretation of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g.,",
    "of them, or parts of them to meaningful information (e.g., by looking at the strings of bits that they comprise, concluding specific valid credit-card numbers; e.g., see data encryption). Change and access logging records who accessed which attributes, what was changed, and when it was changed. Logging services allow for a forensic database audit later by keeping a record of access occurrences and changes. Sometimes application-level code is used to record changes rather than leaving this in the database. Monitoring can be set up to attempt to detect security breaches. Therefore, organizations must take database security seriously because of the many benefits it provides. Organizations will be safeguarded from security",
    "many benefits it provides. Organizations will be safeguarded from security breaches and hacking activities like firewall intrusion, virus spread, and ransom ware. This helps in protecting the company's essential information, which cannot be shared with outsiders at any cause. == Transactions and concurrency == Database transactions can be used to introduce some level of fault tolerance and data integrity after recovery from a crash. A database transaction is a unit of work, typically encapsulating a number of operations over a database (e.g., reading a database object, writing, acquiring or releasing a lock, etc.), an abstraction supported in database and also other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms",
    "other systems. Each transaction has well defined boundaries in terms of which program/code executions are included in that transaction (determined by the transaction's programmer via special transaction commands). The acronym ACID describes some ideal properties of a database transaction: atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. == Migration == A database built with one DBMS is not portable to another DBMS (i.e., the other DBMS cannot run it). However, in some situations, it is desirable to migrate a database from one DBMS to another. The reasons are primarily economical (different DBMSs may have different total costs of ownership or TCOs), functional, and operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves",
    "operational (different DBMSs may have different capabilities). The migration involves the database's transformation from one DBMS type to another. The transformation should maintain (if possible) the database related application (i.e., all related application programs) intact. Thus, the database's conceptual and external architectural levels should be maintained in the transformation. It may be desired that also some aspects of the architecture internal level are maintained. A complex or large database migration may be a complicated and costly (one-time) project by itself, which should be factored into the decision to migrate. This is in spite of the fact that tools may exist to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor",
    "to help migration between specific DBMSs. Typically, a DBMS vendor provides tools to help import databases from other popular DBMSs. == Building, maintaining, and tuning == After designing a database for an application, the next stage is building the database. Typically, an appropriate general-purpose DBMS can be selected to be used for this purpose. A DBMS provides the needed user interfaces to be used by database administrators to define the needed application's data structures within the DBMS's respective data model. Other user interfaces are used to select needed DBMS parameters (like security related, storage allocation parameters, etc.). When the database is ready (all its data structures and other needed components",
    "is ready (all its data structures and other needed components are defined), it is typically populated with initial application's data (database initialization, which is typically a distinct project; in many cases using specialized DBMS interfaces that support bulk insertion) before making it operational. In some cases, the database becomes operational while empty of application data, and data are accumulated during its operation. After the database is created, initialized and populated it needs to be maintained. Various database parameters may need changing and the database may need to be tuned (tuning) for better performance; application's data structures may be changed or added, new related application programs may be written to add",
    "added, new related application programs may be written to add to the application's functionality, etc. == Backup and restore == Sometimes it is desired to bring a database back to a previous state (for many reasons, e.g., cases when the database is found corrupted due to a software error, or if it has been updated with erroneous data). To achieve this, a backup operation is done occasionally or continuously, where each desired database state (i.e., the values of its data and their embedding in database's data structures) is kept within dedicated backup files (many techniques exist to do this effectively). When it is decided by a database administrator to bring",
    "When it is decided by a database administrator to bring the database back to this state (e.g., by specifying this state by a desired point in time when the database was in this state), these files are used to restore that state. == Static analysis == Static analysis techniques for software verification can be applied also in the scenario of query languages. In particular, the *Abstract interpretation framework has been extended to the field of query languages for relational databases as a way to support sound approximation techniques. The semantics of query languages can be tuned according to suitable abstractions of the concrete domain of data. The abstraction of relational",
    "of the concrete domain of data. The abstraction of relational database systems has many interesting applications, in particular, for security purposes, such as fine-grained access control, watermarking, etc. == Miscellaneous features == Other DBMS features might include: Database logs \u2013 This helps in keeping a history of the executed functions. Graphics component for producing graphs and charts, especially in a data warehouse system. Query optimizer \u2013 Performs query optimization on every query to choose an efficient query plan (a partial order (tree) of operations) to be executed to compute the query result. May be specific to a particular storage engine. Tools or hooks for database design, application programming, application program",
    "Tools or hooks for database design, application programming, application program maintenance, database performance analysis and monitoring, database configuration monitoring, DBMS hardware configuration (a DBMS and related database may span computers, networks, and storage units) and related database mapping (especially for a distributed DBMS), storage allocation and database layout monitoring, storage migration, etc.Increasingly, there are calls for a single system that incorporates all of these core functionalities into the same build, test, and deployment framework for database management and source control. Borrowing from other developments in the software industry, some market such offerings as \"DevOps for database\". == Design and modeling == The first task of a database designer is to",
    "== The first task of a database designer is to produce a conceptual data model that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database. A common approach to this is to develop an entity\u2013relationship model, often with the aid of drawing tools. Another popular approach is the Unified Modeling Language. A successful data model will accurately reflect the possible state of the external world being modeled: for example, if people can have more than one phone number, it will allow this information to be captured. Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about",
    "the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organization, like \"can a customer also be a supplier?\", or \"if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?\", or \"if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?\". The answers to these questions establish definitions of the terminology used for entities (customers, products, flights, flight segments) and their relationships and attributes. Producing the conceptual data model sometimes involves input from business processes, or the analysis of workflow in the organization. This",
    "processes, or the analysis of workflow in the organization. This can help to establish what information is needed in the database, and what can be left out. For example, it can help when deciding whether the database needs to hold historic data as well as current data. Having produced a conceptual data model that users are happy with, the next stage is to translate this into a schema that implements the relevant data structures within the database. This process is often called logical database design, and the output is a logical data model expressed in the form of a schema. Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least)",
    "Whereas the conceptual data model is (in theory at least) independent of the choice of database technology, the logical data model will be expressed in terms of a particular database model supported by the chosen DBMS. (The terms data model and database model are often used interchangeably, but in this article we use data model for the design of a specific database, and database model for the modeling notation used to express that design). The most popular database model for general-purpose databases is the relational model, or more precisely, the relational model as represented by the SQL language. The process of creating a logical database design using this model uses",
    "of creating a logical database design using this model uses a methodical approach known as normalization. The goal of normalization is to ensure that each elementary \"fact\" is only recorded in one place, so that insertions, updates, and deletions automatically maintain consistency. The final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance, scalability, recovery, security, and the like, which depend on the particular DBMS. This is often called physical database design, and the output is the physical data model. A key goal during this stage is data independence, meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are",
    "purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications. There are two types of data independence: Physical data independence and logical data independence. Physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements, and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns, and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen DBMS. Another aspect of physical database design is security. It involves both defining access control to database objects as well as defining security levels and methods for the data itself. === Models === A database model is a type of data model that determines the logical structure of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data",
    "of a database and fundamentally determines in which manner data can be stored, organized, and manipulated. The most popular example of a database model is the relational model (or the SQL approximation of relational), which uses a table-based format.

A single database can have any number of views at the external level. The conceptual level (or logical level) unifies the various external views into a compatible global view. It provides the synthesis of all the external views. It is out of the scope of the various database end-users, and is rather of interest to database application developers and database administrators. The internal",
    "interest to database application developers and database administrators. The internal level (or physical level) is the internal organization of data inside a DBMS. It is concerned with cost, performance, scalability and other operational matters. It deals with storage layout of the data, using storage structures such as indexes to enhance performance. Occasionally it stores data of individual views (materialized views), computed from generic data, if performance justification exists for such redundancy. It balances all the external views' performance requirements, possibly conflicting, in an attempt to optimize overall performance across all activities.While there is typically only one conceptual and internal view of the data, there can be any number of different",
    "of the data, there can be any number of different external views. This allows users to see database information in a more business-related way rather than from a technical, processing viewpoint. For example, a financial department of a company needs the payment details of all employees as part of the company's expenses, but does not need details about employees that are in the interest of the human resources department. Thus different departments need different views of the company's database. The three-level database architecture relates to the concept of data independence which was one of the major initial driving forces of the relational model. The idea is that changes made at",
    "the relational model. The idea is that changes made at a certain level do not affect the view at a higher level. For example, changes in the internal level do not affect application programs written using conceptual level interfaces, which reduces the impact of making physical changes to improve performance. The conceptual view provides a level of indirection between internal and external. On the one hand it provides a common view of the database, independent of different external view structures, and on the other hand it abstracts away details of how the data are stored or managed (internal level). In principle every level, and even every external view, can be",
    "principle every level, and even every external view, can be presented by a different data model. In practice usually a given DBMS uses the same data model for both the external and the conceptual levels (e.g., relational model). The internal level, which is hidden inside the DBMS and depends on its implementation, requires a different level of detail and uses its own types of data structure types. == Research == Database technology has been an active research topic since the 1960s, both in academia and in the research and development groups of companies (for example IBM Research).
